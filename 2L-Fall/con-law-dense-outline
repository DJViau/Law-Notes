CON LAW CASE OUTLINE

    EQUALITY

        SLAVERY AND JIM CROW

            DRED SCOTT- federalized the definition of citizenship

            PLESSY- 14th amendment guarantees political equality, not social equality

            BROWN V BOE- abandons the historical approach, overrules plessy

        RATIONAL BASIS REVIEW

            BEAZER- suspect classification? legitimate purpose? rationally related?

            MORENO- bare desire to harm != legit gov purpose

            CLEBURNE- irrational fit != rationally related. bare desire analysis.

            ROMER- sweeping unprecedented penalty on a single group == bare desire to harm

            MINNESOTA v CLOVER LEAF- means antitheitcal to end still passes RBR

            RAILWAY EXPRESS- leg can hit a problem incrementally

            WILLIAMSON v LEE OPTICAL- court will invent a suitable purpose in RBR

        HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY AND RACE

            STRAUDER v WV- stigma.  eq of outcome v eq of opporunity. here 14thA = open jury, but not representative of population

            KOREMATSU- intro to SS.  compelling gov purpose key here. no fit talk

                use it as a negative precedent.

            LOVING- zero point for SS.  "Racial Integrity" != CGP

            WASHINGTON v DAVIS- infer discriminatory intent from the totality of the circumstances to trigger SS on a facially neutral statute

            MCCLESKY v KEMP- racially discriminatory purpose = "because of" not "in spite of"

                dissent: slippery slppe arg is fear of too much justice

            ADARAND- Affirmative Action is subject to SS.  All laws that use race on their face get SS.

                push SS in the direction of colorblindness by treating it as fatal in fact

            GRUTTER- a holistic admission policy that uses race is narrowly tailored

            GRATZ- quota and points systems are not narrowly tailored

            PARENTS INVOLVED- racial balancing != CGP, sunset provision helps narrow tailoring.

                K: schools should be allowed to take race into consideration, but not by reducing the value of any one person to his race. dignity

                beyond control? voluntary?  immutable? relevant?

            FISHER v U OF TEXAS- refines AA jurisprudence. make sure theres a strong fit!

            SCHUETTE v BAMN- AA case. change in the political process connected to race.

                Kennedy talks about dignity again.  no reducing voters to their race.

                Sotomayor says race is a reality, not an abstract problem.  race is only for non-whites. it's not introduced by gov, it's out there in society.  gov should be empowered to address the problem.  no tying the hands of the gov with colorblindness. (use her if a racial classification should survive)

                Thomas and Scalia: colorblindess.

        HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY AND GENDER

            FRONTIERO- analogize a candidate for suspect classification to race.  sex gets SS. immutable, unrelated characteristic (nature of discrimination) are not suitable grounds for legislation.

            CRAIG v BOREN- SS for sex abandoned. intro to intermediate scrutiny.  no nonsense, must have real justifications. no archaic overbroad stereotyping in lawmaking. court wants to smoke out invidious discrimination.  there's gotta be a connection of the means to a legit gov purpose thats set up in advance.

                Gov's failure to produce legit explanations allows the court to infer invidious discrimination.

            US v VA- adds "exceedingly persuasive justification" no post hoc invention of purpose or fit.

            NGUYEN v INS- biological facts aout the sexes != stereotypes

            ROMER v EVANS II- defies EP analysis bc this law is off the charts.

                bare desire to harm == gov is not producing any independent justification for the regulation.

                    court is supposed to make up stuff, but it doesn't

            CLEBURNE II- popularity(discrete and insular), mutability, relevance of a trait

                court makes a meta-arg about where a classification belongs

        IMPLIED FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS

            PRIVILEGES & IMMUNITIES / SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS

                SLAUGHTER-HOUSE CASES- 14thA is only about slaves, P&I drained

                LOCHNER V. NEW YORK- state can't abridge fundamental right to contract

                    negative precedent.
                    accuse a person of making up a FR with lochner.
                        'youre undisciplined and political'

                HOME BUILDING & LOAN V. BLAISDELL- can’t contract in a way that defeats the police power.  end of lochner.

                    beefs up a claim in favor of ANY police power use by state.
                    use for any claim involving regulatory authority.

                NEBBIA V. NEW YORK- way more permissive and deferential than lochner

                WEST COAST HOTEL V. PARRISH- regulation is ubiquitous, anything thats not crazy is fine, there is no right to contract.  defer to congress. freedom is achieved through appropriate regulation.

                UNITED STATES V. CAROLENE PRODUCTS- legislation affecting commercial contracts is now presumed constitutional.

                    carolene products footnote 4 big preview of finding FR

                        use in conjunction with forntiero and clebure to handle a new classification and youre trying to decide what classification it gets


            EQUAL PROTECTION AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS

                analogize to race.  history and nature of discrimination.

                SKINNER V. OKLAHOMA- outcome-oriented analysis of fundamental rights, strict scrutiny applies.  EP/FR overlap.  They claim to apply SS, at least.

                SAN ANTONIO INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT V. RODRIGUEZ- no FR to edu, poor is not a suspect class.  quasi-IR applied to non-suspect class.  FR must be closely linked to the textual right.

                PLYLER V. DOE- showed FR implication of total denial of education.  quasi-intermediate level of review

                    no FR, no suspect class, still a HR applied


            PRIVACY, PERSONHOOD, AND THE FAMILY

                GRISWOLD V. CONNECTICUT- right to privacy [in marriage]. infers a right from the text, penumbras, emanations, zones.  way of looking to the text and drawing an inference of FR from something listed.  inference need not be close.

                ROE V. WADE- the consequences argument sweeps abortion into FR.  first trimester was off limits.  FR to privacy, but gov can reg when interest is compelling.

                MAHER V. ROE- no gov obligation to fund abortion

                HARRIS V. MCRAE- no guarantee of a meaningful exercise of your rights

                PLANNED PARENTHOOD V. CASEY- big case. FR to privacy as autonomy/self-definition. undue burden std. dive into full notes. interest is always compelling even from conception.

                    UBS: purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the way of a woman getting an abortion.
                    court has a wish for the gov to be able to regulate.

                GONZALEZ V. CARHART- upheld bc alternatives available

                MOORE V. CITY OF EAST CLEVELAND- FR to family found, but no SS

                ZABLOCKI V. REDHAIL- FR to marriage found, but no SS.  they say they're gonna handle it as an EP claim, they use some kind of IR.

                    sooo many regulations in the area of marriage, and they don't want to call them all into question.
                    FR would put it out of bounds altogether
                    EP would just push them off this regulation.

                BOWERS V. HARDWICK- Defined the right narrowly, no FR found. restrictive tradition-based strategy.

                LAWRENCE V. TEXAS- overturns bowers. broad def of FR to privacy, FR found. Trajectory method.

                WASHINGTON V. GLUCKSBERG- No FR to suicide.  Order: Look to history and define a right narrowly, or else lochner.  Constraining methodology. Tends to not see FR.

                UNITED STATES V. WINDSOR- federal version of romer. reinforces bare desire to harm. too sweeping, too profound a penalty, assult to dignity. defies EP analysis.

                OBERGEFELL V. HODGES- gay marriage ok, but still FR to autonomy



    EXPRESSION

        CONTENT-BASED RESTRICTIONS

            SCHENCK V. UNITED STATES- bad tendency test, purpose and effect bound together.  context-free test. first sighting of clear and present danger.

                -what was said
                -can i imagine harmful natural consequence

            FROHWERK V. UNITED STATES- judges can imagine danger? then jail.

            DEBS V. UNITED STATES- one dangerous element? then jail.

            ABRAMS V. UNITED STATES- holmes's dissent intros clear and present danger test

            GITLOW V. NEW YORK- advocacy is still forbidden

            WHITNEY V. CALIFORNIA- deferent to legislature. brandeis adds to the usual dissent:

                speech stabilizes bc it vents
                self development
                self governance

            DENNIS V. UNITED STATES- learned hand  CPD test. gravity of evil times probability of success

                CPDT adds the where and when of speech as limiting factors

            BRANDENBURG V. OHIO- likely to incite, actually incites. peak of dangerous speech run. more speech protection.

                -advocating or inciting lawless action?
                -likely to actually cause such action?

                    then gov can criminalize your speech

                    this embeds some consideration of context
                    but its really about connection to conduct
                    jives with o'brien in that it lets gov reg conduct
                    but also protects the speech element

            HOLDER V. HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT- reverts to deference. CGP, but not NT.

                court buys that material aid statute advances terrorism. this is the kind of speech gov can criminalize. end of dangerous speech run.  circumvents brandenburg. deference to congress. ignores context, gets back to abstract bad tendency.

                but these people are advocating lawful action with their speech
                    so they fail the brandenburg test, but the court upholds anyhow
                this is core speech criminalized, so only permissible if passes SS
                    they should fail, says dissent

                Feels like a big step backwards toward DENNIS and BAD TENDENCY


            SHIFT FROM DANGEROUS TO FALSE SPEECH


            NEW YORK TIMES V. SULLIVAN- goals: uninhibited robust wide open dialogue.  concern for chilling effects. actual malice standard.  applies to officials in official capacity.

            CURTIS PUBLISHING CO. V. BUTTS/ASSOCIATED PRESS V. WALKER- public figures are like public officials.

            GERTZ V. ROBERT WELCH INC.- less public debate is less protected speech

            DUN & BRADSTREET V. GREENMOSS BUILDERS- actual malice not neccessary to prove libel in a private setting bc no chilling effect on public debate but state interest in preservig dignity remains

            UNITED STATES V. ALVAREZ- SS applies bc too broad a reg. you lose the battle unless you can get the law pushed into one of the low-value speech categories.  to uphold would give gov power to censor.

        CONTENT NEUTRALITY: SYMBOLIC CONDUCT

            UNITED STATES V. O’BRIEN- four part test to make sure gov only regulates the conduct elements of symbolic speech.

                -gov has power?
                -important gov interest?
                -gov interest unrelated to free speech?
                -incidental burden on speech?

            BARNES V. GLEN THEATER- intro to secondary effects

            CITY OF ERIE V. PAP’S A.M.- ok despite targeting live nude dancing for its secondary effects bc pasties and a g string only has an incidental impact on the erotic message


                BROADLY:
                If we let everyone determine for themselves what counts as speech or as religion, we get anarchy.
                without a sufficiently sensitve test, we end with either tyranny or anarchy.
                regs to readily: tyranny
                regs no enough: anarchy

                secular/nonspeech goal of gov?
                least possible impact on speech/religion?


    RELIGION

        BASIC ISSUES AND NON-COERCION

            EVERSON V. BOARD OF EDUCATION- you can't roll up sidewalks in front of a church

            LEE V. WEISMAN- freedom from religion. no coercive bullshit.

        NON-ENDORSEMENT AND FACIAL NEUTRALITY

            LYNCH V. DONNELLY- intro to oconnor endorsement test

            MUELLER V. ALLEN- parental decision launders gov money going to church

            ZELMAN V. SIMMONS-HARRIS- voucher program pushes zelman further

            TOWN OF GREECE V. GALLOWAY- there is no limit on sectarian intrusion into gov

        REQUIRED ACCOMMODATIONS

            gov has not acted yet, church asks for some sweet deal from gov

            BRAUNFELD V. BROWN- for incidental burdens. (like obrien test) deferntial to gov regs.  ask:

                -permissible end?
                -secular goal?

                then gov gets to have that regulation.

                if gov fails, then gov is regulating speech.

                if that speech is not low value, then SS applies.

            SHERBERT V. VERNER- for substantial burdens. restricted by rigorous inquiry into whether the burden is substantial. ask:

                -is the burden substantial?
                -complelling state interest?
                -no other reg would handle it?

                strict limit on gov regs that restrict free exercise, pull out if you want an accommodation

            WISCONSIN V. YODER- court is willing to accommodate favored religions

            EMPLOYMENT DIVISION V. SMITH- flips back to deference to gov. less protection that braunfeld.

        PERMISSIBLE ACCOMMODATIONS

            where: gov has already acted to give a sweet deal to the church

            LATTER DAY SAINTS V. AMOS- equal opportunity employment burden lifted from church. back to lemon test.

            TEXAS MONTHLY V. BULLOCK- targeted accommodation impermissible where:

                -benefits church
                -does not lift a state-imposed burden
                -burdens non-beneficiaries markedly

            BOARD OF EDUCATION OF KIRYAS JOEL V. GRUMET- this accommodation acts like endorsement without a guarantee of similar accommodation for others
