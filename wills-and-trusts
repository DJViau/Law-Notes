WILLS AND TRUSTS DAY 1

Forced share: certain amount goes to [each kid]

community property state: earnings in a marriage are split 50/50

	12 are cps

	the rest are separate property states

elective share: allows a spouse to claim a portion of the decedent’s estate despite a will to the contrary 

	public policy restriction on testator freedom

	Georgia has no elective share and is not a community property state.  you can do anything when you die

	type of forced share

ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE: donor’s intent

	to be read from the document


SHAPIRA v UNION

testate: died with a will

intestate: died without a will

specific devises: give a particular thing to a particular group

general devise: cash gift

residuary clause: sweeps up the rest

gift over clause: to A but if A is not alive, to B

-argued unconst under 14th amdnmnt

personal representative: person who will handle the estate

	if you have a will, you name the person in the will

	if you don’t have a will, there’s a statute 

	this displaced the now-outdated “executor/administrator”

-it’s not a violation of the 14th for a state court to deal with church-related restrictions on testator’s behalf

the state atty general is always in charge of prosecuting this kind of thing on behalf of a church or charity

-14th am issue thrown out

-public policy argument

	if its a partial restriction, it’s generally valid

	this one doesn’t stop someone from marrying, only directs it

	marry a jew is fine, marry no one is not acceptable

	limiting to the pool of jewish women is just fine

	limiting to 7 years just fine

clients always want to control the behavior of the recipient

“no remarriage” would be struck

the modern solution to this problem is the trust

B puts money in trust for the benefit of A during A’s lifetime, with the remainder to B’s children

this trust structure has taken over the turf formerly occupied by wills like Shapira’s

tax incentives tend to compel trust structures

if you put any kind of restriction on A’s money, you lose the unlimited marital estate tax deduction

so you can usually convince a person to switch off the restriction by telling them they’ll lose 40 percent to the estate tax



RIGHT TO INHERIT, RIGHT TO CONVEY

you do not have a right to inherit

you do not have a constitutional right to devise (there are some restrictions)

after Hodel and Babbit, you have a constitutional right to devise to your children

native americans don’t have wills quite as often as most americans

the property passes through intestacy statutes

A dies, blackacre passes to the children as tenants in common

this, over time, fractionalized the land 

the investors bought a small share, forced a sale, and bought it cheap



top choices for property on death:

1- government confiscation
2- forced shares
3- testator freedom


	we have a combination of all three of these

	federal level has transfer tax (above 5.43 million gets a 40% tax, except to charities and US spouses)

	states mostly have inheritance tax 

	forced share common throughout world, but not here



ways to get funds from parents to kids:

	lifetime gifts (limited per person and comes out of your 5.4m limit, annual exclusion is 14k per person per 	year)
		
		generation skipping transfer (limited to 5.4m too)

		bargain sale to kids similar

	move (funds or domicile, this avoids state inheritance tax)

		you could also move offshore

	salary you kid in the business (stupidly high salary, but limited by IRS)

	give the gift of education (human and cultural capital)

		support is a legal obligation, you can fulfill that magnificently (food shelter clothing education) and it is 		not a taxable gift

		you can make unlimited medical and educational expenses straight to the provider without taxation

	tangible personal property (give gold and diamonds to the kids, no paper trail not even a title)

	
65% of the IRS budget is spent on enforcement

	as a political matter we don’t want indefinite political and economic oligopolies
