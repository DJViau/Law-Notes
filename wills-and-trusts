WILLS AND TRUSTS DAY 1

	Forced share: certain amount goes to [each kid]

	community property state: earnings in a marriage are split 50/50

		12 are cps

		the rest are separate property states

	elective share: allows a spouse to claim a portion of the decedent’s estate despite a will to the contrary

		public policy restriction on testator freedom

		Georgia has no elective share and is not a community property state.  you can do anything when you die

		type of forced share

	ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE: donor’s intent, to be read from the document

	SHAPIRA v UNION

	testate: died with a will

	intestate: died without a will

	specific devises: give a particular thing to a particular group

	general devise: cash gift

	residuary clause: sweeps up the rest

	gift over clause: to A but if A is not alive, to B

	-argued unconst under 14th amdnmnt

	personal representative: person who will handle the estate

		if you have a will, you name the person in the will

		if you don’t have a will, there’s a statute

		this displaced the now-outdated “executor/administrator”

	-it’s not a violation of the 14th for a state court to deal with church-related restrictions on testator’s behalf

		the state atty general is always in charge of prosecuting this kind of thing on behalf of a church or charity

	-14th am issue thrown out

	-public policy argument

		if its a partial restriction, it’s generally valid

		this one doesn’t stop someone from marrying, only directs it

		marry a jew is fine, marry no one is not acceptable

		limiting to the pool of jewish women is just fine

		limiting to 7 years just fine

	clients always want to control the behavior of the recipient

	“no remarriage” would be struck

	the modern solution to this problem is the trust

	B puts money in trust for the benefit of A during A’s lifetime, with the remainder to B’s children

	this trust structure has taken over the turf formerly occupied by wills like Shapira’s

	tax incentives tend to compel trust structures

	if you put any kind of restriction on A’s money, you lose the unlimited marital estate tax deduction

	so you can usually convince a person to switch off the restriction by telling them they’ll lose 40 percent to the estate tax

	RIGHT TO INHERIT, RIGHT TO CONVEY

		you do not have a right to inherit

		you do not have a constitutional right to devise (there are some restrictions)

		after Hodel and Babbit, you have a constitutional right to devise to your children

		native americans don’t have wills quite as often as most americans

		the property passes through intestacy statutes

		A dies, blackacre passes to the children as tenants in common

		this, over time, fractionalized the land

		the investors bought a small share, forced a sale, and bought it cheap

	top choices for property on death:

		1- government confiscation
		2- forced shares
		3- testator freedom

			we have a combination of all three of these

			federal level has transfer tax (above 5.43 million gets a 40% tax, except to charities and US spouses)

			states mostly have inheritance tax

			forced share common throughout world, but not here

		ways to get funds from parents to kids:

			lifetime gifts (limited per person and comes out of your 5.4m limit, annual exclusion is 14k per person per 	year)

				generation skipping transfer (limited to 5.4m too)

				bargain sale to kids similar

			move (funds or domicile, this avoids state inheritance tax)

				you could also move offshore

			salary your kid in the business (stupidly high salary, but limited by IRS)

			give the gift of education (human and cultural capital)

				support is a legal obligation, you can fulfill that magnificently (food shelter clothing education) and it is 		not a taxable gift

				you can make unlimited medical and educational expenses straight to the provider without taxation

			tangible personal property (give gold and diamonds to the kids, no paper trail not even a title)

	65% of the IRS budget is spent on enforcement

		as a political matter we don’t want indefinite political and economic oligopolies


WILLS DAY 2

		There can be partial intestacy if there’s no residuary clause.

	Marylin Monroe case

		Courts normally appoint the competent person who’s getting the most stuff

		Shaw’s daughter’s v Anna is the real conflict

		Shaw LLC licensed some images to target in Indiana

		Indiana recognized a descendible right of publicity, but it wasn’t in effect until after MM died

		one theory: you can only pass by will what you own at your death

		real property is governed by its situs

		domicile at death governs for everything else

		residency is defined by IRS and governs for income tax purposes

		domicile is different

		neither NY or CA had a statute in place at the time of the sale of the t shirt purporting to retroactively protect publicity rights post-mortem

		ancillary probate is for the out of state stuff.  its hellish

		instead of going through that crap

		put it into a trust or LLC and then it’s not real property that’s passing, but intangible real property

		BAR EXAM likes these distinctions

		heir is someone who would take under intestacy

		devisees, beneficiaries, and legatees take under a will

		Braman rule sends posthumously acquired property to the heir

		UPC uniform probate code sends it to the residuary devisee

		“to t if t survives me, but if not, to t’s estate” bad drafting

		“to …, then to whoever would take under the residuary clause of T’s will”

		Gov Schwarzenegger passed a law in CA that purported to create a retroactive right of publicity

		the fed estate tax is supposed to apply to what the person owns at the date of death

		is this calculated on the snapshot of the day of death, or is it calculated by accounting for the post-death publicity boom?


	PROBATE AND NONPROBATE

		probate includes anything under a will, testamentary trust, anything in your sole name like a checking account, real estate

		non probate includes life insurance policies, inter vivos trust, joint tenancies, retirement (401k account), transfer on death/payable on death accounts, TOD real estate

		THIS ALL GETS TAXED, whether probate or not.  it’s all in the gross estate on death.

		Will says life insurance to X, policy says beneficiary is Y.  BAR EXAM: policy goes to Y

		similarly, a will cannot overcome a joint tenancy, or the 401k designated beneficiary

		CREDITORS get paid before beneficiaries

	WHY PROBATE?

		collect assets, pay creditors, prepare accounting, final income tax ret, federal estate tax return (if over 5.43m), state inheritance/estate tax ret, deal with tangible personal property, clear and transfer the titles, deal with ancillary administration

		accounting  a list of all the assets of the estate and a value assigned to it

		real estate needs appraisal, a company needs appraisal ($20k)

		the PR files the decedent’s final taxes and the estate itself also files an income tax return

		the IRS requires valuation at death and six months later

		the state also requires their bite, they usually use the fed numbers

		inheritance tax means you pay a different amount based on who you left it to (kids taxed lower than others)

		Estate tax is always the same, no matter who the funds go to

		many states still have the million dollar cap

	Probate Types

		1) formal probate - big, expensive, lots of people involved

		2) informal probate - has grown up in the last 20 years.  if no interested party objects after getting notice of the will, then it doesn’t need court supervision.  the PR gets appointed, and the court signs off at the end, not other involvement.  notice goes to last known address.

		3) small - anything under 40-50 grand.  no court needed.  just go to clerk or registrar and you can get title.

		interested party- heirs, beneficiaries under the will, and the known creditors

		DMV has a procedure.  you bring death cert and will, and the DMV will flip the title

		real estate in your sole name has to be cleared up.  if the person takes over real estate without clearing up the title, it will be tricky to get clear title. you need probate then.

		professionals like doctors should go through probate because it bars creditors under non claim statutes

		posting notice in the newspaper limits the window for creditors to come forward

		a guardian at litem represents a minor.  they’ll insist on a formal probate proceeding.

WILLS DAY 3

	SIMPSON v CALIVAS

		homestead goes to wife

		everything else goes to kids

		the issue is what homestead means

		the property had hundreds of acres and a handful of business buildings too

		the kid wanted the rest of the property, and was happy to let the stepmom take the house

		[step-relations and caregivers end up in the casebook]

		the attorney notes say that the house goes to the wife along with a bit of the land around it, but everything else goes to the son

		the notes aren’t allowed into the probate proceeding

		the son sued the atty

		also he bought up the mom’s life estate interest for 400k

		3rd parties can’t sue on a contract because there’s no privity

			the estate can always sue on malpractice, but the estate usually suffers no damages

			the third party has no traditional standing, but definitely has damages

			the testator can’t sue because he’s fucking dead

		MOST STATES have done away with the privity requirement, but not NY

		the malpractice claim was not brought in a probate court, but rather in a court of general jdx

		in the general court, the atty’s own notes sunk his ship

		the probate court’s only function is to interpret the will by the clear text of the will itself.  no extrinsic evidence allowed.  probate courts have a different function than other courts.

	A v B

		NJ firm Hill Wallack

		Married couple goes to the same law firm

		names get entered into the database to check for conflicts of interest

		each spouse names the other, with the kids as contingent beneficiaries  (CLASSIC)

		state laws don’t differentiate between children born from a marriage and children not born from a marriage

		separately

		Mom brings a paternity suit with a different branch of the office

		when they did the lookup, they spelled the name wrong

		(A is mom, B is husband)

		the atty representing mom withdraws when they find out the conflict of interest

		but now the firm knows about this illegitimate child

		so now

		1.4 (duty to inform) is in conflict with 1.6 (duty to inform of material info)

		this is material to the estate planning representation because if she dies first, her dough could end up going to the illegitimate child

		NJ had tweaked this duty to inform to permissive

		there’s not a fraud that will cause serious bodily injury or serious financial harm

		but they may because telling will help clear up a fraud

		so the firm is allowed to tell if they want to

		but they don’t have to

		the firm wants to

		the husband gets notice from the firm that it’s gonna be him or the firm who tells her

		he doesn’t want to

		so he gets an injunction against that shit

		if she wants to stay married and block the bastard, she could make a trust

		wife’s assets into trust, mandatory income to benefit B, remainder principal to wife’s children

		this is a QTIP trust and qualifies for some kind of exemption

		in most jdx, wife has to leave B at least 1/2 because of forced share

			legal separation, spouse still gets elective share in almost all jdx

	INTESTACY

		if you die without a will, you die intestate

		EXAM:  elective share. study it.

		A and B are married.  A leaves everything to the kids.  B may elect against the will and grab that elective share.

		you can also take an elective share in intestacy.

		in this chapter, we’re studying the intestacy share.  it’s why the gov’t thinks the decedent would want.

		THE ELECTIVE SHARE CAN OVERCOME THE INTESTACY SCHEME.

		the elective share can be higher than the intestate share

		the intestacy statutes often only apply to probate assets

		the elective share is often a lower percentage, but it applies to a bigger pile

		 under UPC intestacy flow, you get a higher percent if you have no extramarital children

		intestacy share doesn’t care how long you’ve been married, elective share does.


WILLS DAY 4

		Childless couples are the demographic that bring up the simultaneous death problem.

		USDA says a survivor must outlive the decedent by five days

		simultaneous death for joint tenants: split the value between the [parents]

	good drafting:

		go beyond the five days (five days doesn’t prevent strategic behavior by the parents)

		set up a thirty (60, or 90) day window to override the five day presumption

		you can go up to six months (IRS won’t allow it)

		[if X dies simultaneously or within 60 days of T, X is deemed to have predeceased T]

		this lets you figure out where A’s stuff would go if there was no spouse B in the picture, without any splitting or litigating

		UPC and USDA: 5 days, 1/2 and 1/2

	Where to make the “first cut”:

		1) ENGLISH - first cut always at children’s level

		2) MODERN - first cut at the level where someone is alive

		3) UPC - same as modern

		modern method: first cut, disburse, pool funds, go to next level, disburse, pool funds, go to next level, etc

		under the UPC, everyone on the same level should get the same percentage

	TWO SOLID, UNIVERSAL RULES:

		1) when a line dies out, you ignore it completely
		2) ignore a descendant whose parent is alive

		p84 problem 1:

		English:

		D 1/2
		F 1/4
		G 1/8
		H 1/8

		Modern:

		D 1/3
		F 1/3
		G 1/6
		H 1/6

		UPC:

		D 1/3
		F 1/3
		G 1/6
		H 1/6

		UPC:

		anyone who is not a lineal descendant of a grandparent does not take

		they give half to maternal grandparent’s side and half to paternal grandparent’s side

		when you disinherit someone, you can’t block his line, but you can skip him so he’s treated like he’s dead

		you can explicitly disinherit B and his whole line, but if you only disinherit B, it only skips him

WILLS DAY 5

	Hall v Vallandingham

		Widow with kids remarries.  Can the kids inherit through their dead father where they were adopted by the new hubby?

		decedent died intestate

		his estate should go to his heirs. does this include the adopted kids?

		the transplantation theory says that if someone else adopts the children, then they are not the descendants of the genetic parents

	Adopting adults:

		1- after a true parent-child relationship, to catch up with the situation post-facto

		2- same sex partnership adoption  A adopts B to allow B to take with priority over those who might contest a will
			A’s heirs have standing (often parents of A, who disapproved) and can make for a shitty time
			they challenge the will based on undue influence, etc
				R: only heirs and beneficiaries under a prior will can have standing

			problems:  this is statutory incest sometimes.  criminal prosecution and 30+ years in jail
						NY, et al disallow the adoption of a person you’re sleeping with
						the relationship often sours after the adoption.  there’s no divorce for adoption.

		3- partner adopted to make person beneficiary of a transfer

	Minary v citizens fidelity bank and trust co

		binary sets up a testamentary trust that named her husband, then her kids and then at the death of the survivor, the corpus goes to her heirs or else a church

		there were some living kids, so they would have been heirs

		but this guy Alfred wants to cut his wife into the loot

		so

		he adopts his wife

		this woman is now both his wife and his daughter

		this can potentially make her an heir of mrs minary and a beneficiary of the will

		the kids don’t want to share with this bitch

		so they sue

		the court looks at

		the adoption statutes from 32 when the trust was established
		the adoption statutes then in force

		the old way is the “stranger to the adoption rule”

			if A adopts B, and A dies, B can take A’s stuff
			but if T sets up a trust to benefit A and A’s lineal descendants, what then?
				did the adoption happen before the trust?
					then T knew and presumably was OK with B taking
				did the adoption happen after the trust became irrevocable?
					then the stranger rule means T was a stranger to the adoption and we can’t presume A was OK

			Still in place in many JDX, but in kentucky they changed in 53.  kid is now presumptively included

		the will calls for disposition according to the laws then in effect

		the terms of the trust are “pretty clear”

		look at who would be her heirs at the time of distribution
			so we should throw out the stranger to the adoption rule

		the court looks at the statute and decides on the

		“ICK FACTOR”

		they simply don’t care about the letter of the law, they refuse

		“I’m gonna adopt you so that I can make you the benefit of a trust that someone else set up.”

			pretty common

		the UPC allows you to adopt anyone you want to

			but

			to count as heirs, you need to have had a true parent-child relationship while they were minor

	John Goodman

		total asshole

		POOR DRAFTING:

			don’t put a future definition of state law as the binding factor governing some distribution

				1- no idea who the beneficiaries will be
				2- these laws are constantly in flux

			now, you’d give a special power of appointment

			they’d be allowed to specify who they want their share to go to
				(not their estate, not their creditors)

			it would have avoided this litigation

	David Copperfield

		posthumous child: conceived while dad is alive, born while dad is dead

			these kids always take under intestacy statutes

		posthumously conceived child: conceived [by in vitro fertilization] after Dad is dead

			all bets are off.  most state laws don’t handle this at all


		two reasons to bank sperm:

			-to make a child with their own sperm while infertile but living
			-to make a child with their sperm while dead

	Astrue v Capato

			if you’re a kid with a dead genetic parent, you get SS survivor benefits

			that’s what’s at issue

		the mom applied for SS benefits for her (sure thing) and the kids (who were posthumously conceived, this is at issue)

		the SS code defers to the state intestacy law to determine whether you’re eligible for this state benefit

		what if the will specifically includes posthumously conceived children?

		doesn’t matter unless there’s a rule like in FL where you look to the will to determine

		UPC

		1- they want to see a writing, clear and convincing evidence that you intended your gametes to be used to produce a posthumously conceived child

			if they intended to make a baby while living but infertile, it’s a no go

			but

			if you wrote that you’d be happy to make a pcc, then yes for intestacy and SS and definition of children

		we put a time limit in order to keep a sense of finality in probate proceedings

WILLS DAY 6

		Sprinkle Trust: it’s discretionary.  lineal descendants get or don’t get assets from the trust based on a choice by the [surviving spouse].  No mandatory distributions.

			Special Power of Appointment:  Anything that’s not a general power of appointment

				-if you can appoint to only a limited group, its a SPoA

			General Power of Appointment:  A gives B a power of appointment over a certain amount of money.

				-you can appoint yourself, creditors, estate, and creditors of your estate

			Normally A gives B the right to appoint assets (usually in B’s will) where to direct the pile of cash

			A can say:

				B, give it to anyone

				or

				B, give it to any or all of my lineal descendants

		here, lineal descendants means issue

		Abigail gets to appoint from among Martin B’s lineal descendants or else the trust goes by default to the pineals

			IRS says:  general power of appointment is like ownership, and so you get taxed.

				BUT: if you are restricted (SPoA) then it’s not taxed

			so, when you’re drafting, make sure to exclude B, B’s creditors, estate, and creditors of B’s estate

	In re Martin B

		they bring the situation to court to get instructions to follow so that following distributions, the trustee can’t be sued

		An advancement is a lifetime gift to a child that will be counted against that child’s share of his parent’s estate

		the common law presumption was that a gift was an advancement

		but

		now we say that a inter vivos gift is evidence that the parent favored the child more

		the UPC flips the common law rule

			it’s not an advancement unless there’s a contemporaneous writing saying it’s an advancement

		Tangible property is counted

	GUARDIANSHIP AND CONSERVATORSHIP

		someone leaves dough to a kid

		both parents are dead

		who handles the money and the kid until the kid hits the age of majority?

			it’s not always the same person in charge of the kid and the money

	DONT LEAVE IT TO A SURROGATE

		list a few people in succession to decide who looks after the kid

		list a few people in succession to decide who looks after the dough

	COURT APPOINTED GUARDIAN

		“it’s just fucking awful” - Terry Turnipseed

		its like probate every day.  a judge has to sign off on c purchases of clothes etc

		some dipshit lawyer gets the task of cutting checks etc

	CONSERVATOR

		its a little better

		it’s more like a trustee

		but

		you send an accounting once a year and check in on big ticket items


	UTMA “Custodianship”

		better, because it allows a court to appoint a “trustee”

		person who handles the minor’s money has a bit more freedom, less accounting to do

		is not a stranger to the kid

		it’s often best to leave a small amount under the UTMA

	BEST THING:
	TRUST

		the money dumps in

		you specify a trustee

		you get to declare terms

			(in all above the money comes out at 18 or 21 at the latest, and then that kid gets it outright)

		but you can hold the trust until they’re older

		you can specify education first, etc

		trust terms can even survive an adoption!


	SLAYER RULE

		you can’t just kill a person to claim their stuff

		court imposes a constructive trust

		constructive means it’s a legal fiction

		we’re pretending to give title to the slayer so he holds it in trust for someone else


WILLS DAY 7


	DISCLAIMER

		you can disclaim money

		why?

			creditors
			tax avoidance
			medicare

		but the IRS can always get to it

		G->P->GC

		parents will often disclaim their share and let it go to the grandkids, they can skip a generation of taxation

		you save a 40% cut at the feds and more at the state level

		states requirements vary

		feds require:

			-writing
			-9 month window after gift or death
			-take no benefit
			-passes without direction from disclaim ant
			-valid under state law

		the IRS has a form to fill out

		in the 9 months window, you can take no benefit.

		If GP leaves parent a house, parent can’t move in

		it’s ok if the disclaim ant knows where it’s gonna go, but the disclaim ant cannot affirmatively act to flow the money somewhere

			if it just happens to flow to their children under state intestacy law, or a will, thats fine

			but

			if there’s a power of appointment or anything, no go

		validity under state law is necessary but not sufficient

		Well drafted wills and trusts often contain a disclaimer provision

			To A, but if A disclaims, to C [or to a trust for the benefit of C]

			Very common in well-drafted documents

		no disclaimer clause?  then you assume disclaiming has predeceased the grantor

		other disclaimer reason:  to soak up a bit more dough on your side

			UPC prevents this.

	WILL FORMALITIES

		most states still require specific and technical ways of creating a will

			1- WRITING
			2- SIGNED
			3- ATTESTED

		Attestation is the most frequently problematic

		some states also require

			4- Subscription
			5- Publication

		subscription: you need to sign it at the end.  some states throw it out, some throw out all that which follows.

		publication is an approving statement of all the above.  should be part of the execution ceremony.


		Functions of Formalities:

			-Evidentiary
			-Ritual/Cautionary
			-Protective
			-Channeling


		DO NOT ALLOW PEOPLE TO EXECUTE DOCUMENTS ON THEIR OWN THAT YOU HAVE PREPARED FOR THEM

		if you have to, give them a very complete script


		Banks are commonly the place to execute self-written wills


	Stevens v Casdorph

		the walk around the bank means that not everyone saw everyone do everything

		the will was denied


		the testator can sign in advance, as long as he acknowledges it in front of both witnesses


		SIT EVERYONE DOWN, NO ONE LEAVES.  NO SMARTPHONES.

		WE ONLY BREAK AFTER I’VE REVIEWED THE DOCUMENTS.


		ANYTHING you put down that you mean to be your signature is valid

			initials, so long as you mean it to be your signature
			an X, if that’s all you can compose
			a nickname, if that’s what you intend to be your signature (lucky)

			not fine:

				if you start writing your full name, but you don’t finish it

		OR

			someone can sign on your behalf

				if they’re in your presence
				and
				you wish for them to sign the document, and that you mean it to be your signature

			This is true for attestation as well.  the witness can tell someone to write their name as a witness.

			You can also get someone to help you make your signature.  it must be at T’s direction.

		NO HEIRS OR BENEFICIARIES should sign as witnesses

		some jdx throw out the whole thing, some purge the beneficiary, and some purge the difference between the will and the intestate amount

		the ATTY SHOULD NOT also be the witness or the notary

			it adds an ugly wrinkle that will pique a judge’s interest

		The notary is not required, but two witnesses and a notary should all play along

		usually attached to the will is a self-proving affidavit that the witnesses sign

			a notary notarizes it

			it says that we the witnesses are swearing before a notary that all the requirements have been met

		before the advent of the self proving affidavit, you’d have to go find the witnesses and have them testify

		most of the time you can’t even tell the name let alone find the person

		UPC says you can have two witnesses OR a notary

			but that provision of the UPC has not been widely adopted

		Presence

			two tests for presence:

				-old school Line of sight test

					you have to be able to see the testator and the other witnesses

					everyone has to be able to see everyone

					they don’t actually have to have seen, but they have to have been able to see

				-UPC and other jdx have the Conscious Presence Test

					you probably have to be in the same room as the others

		SUBSCRIPTION

			jdx handle things differently (see chart)

			NY tosses out anything below the signature line, and the will above is probated

		ATTESTATION CLAUSE

			a clause that says who it is that’s witnessing the will and provides for witness lines

			in many states, T must sign before Witnesses

		Proper order:

			T signs
			Witnesses sign
			sign self-proving affidavit
			notary signs off

		MAKE SURE THE WILL IS EXTREMELY WELL JOINED TOGETHER

			as many staples as you can put up top

			have the T initial each page

				it makes it harder to slip in a page

		THE MODEL EXECUTION CEREMONY is overkill, but it makes the will hold up in all jdx

			publication:

				we are gathered here to execute the will of X

			3 big questions:

				-Is this you will?
				-Have you read it and understood it?
				-Does it dispose of your property in accordance with your wishes?

					T must answer YES

			ALSO:

				-Do you request that so and so and so and so act as your witnesses?

			REVIEW THE DOCUMENTS

				clear it all up right there if possible
				make sure everyone hangs out


WILLS DAY 8

	Estate of Morea

		two witnesses required

		Kevin was given less than his intestate share

		Kevin was the son

		George was not related, he would have taken nothing under intestacy

			Background interested witness rule:

				-interested witness means your whole will is tossed
				-then they moved to purging

		Now, they purge the difference between benefit that the interested witness would receive under intestacy and under he will

		-some purge the whole interest
			-some states only purge excess

				-some purge relative to intestacy
				-some purge relative to old will

		Kevin ended up getting a taste under the will

		George is an unrelated guy (nothing under intestacy)

			the court let Kevin count as a non-interested witness because he lost dough by testifying
					the other witness was legit

		George was supernumerary  and so it was OK for him to take

		UPC allows all kinds of interested witnesses

			they figure any fraudster would not be dumb enough to sign off as a witness

	Safeguarding Wills:


		Wills get lost

		Wills get ridiculously hidden

		Clients will go home and mark up their own wills

		relatives of clients who didn’t take might make sure that will gets lost as fuck

		clients put their special stuff including wills in a safe deposit box

			relatives don’t know about the box
			relatives can’t find the key
			Even when they can, it’s still a huge pain in the ass because you need a court hand holder

		BEST PRACTICE is probably for the attorney to retain it

			ACTEC counsels for this

		NEVADA HAS AN ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE statute and TENNESEE has a caselaw equivalent

		Will-Swap cases are the main malpractice source for Estate planning attorneys

		Substantial compliance uses a constructive trust

			common law, judge-made

			deems it in compliance even where its not

		more modern is dispensing power (as under UPC)

		also called harmless error rule

			needs a statute

			forgives failure of compliance

			modern trend, accepted in a growing minority of states

		curing defects in execution is governed by a specialized set of rules

		reformation of mistakes in a document has a different set of rules

		the exception to e signing and financial power of attorney are wills

		but

		the FPOA can set up a revocable trust with terms identical to what the will would have been

			then you retitle all the property in the name of the trust

			make sure nothing flows through probate, and then bam you’ve got a new will for an incompetent

		BEST PRACTICE: use the two-step self proving process.

			it’s good in all jdx that allows one-step, but not vice versa

						NEVER DO A JOINT WILL

		PREPRINTED WILL FORMS ARE PROBLEMATIC

		the forms often attempt or purport to be full, attested wills

WILLS DAY 9

	harmless error excuses more than substantial compliance

	NJ had adopted harmless error by Macool

		unsigned will excuses:

			switched wills
			dead signer partway through

	UPC ALLOWS YOU TO SWAP IN A NOTARY FOR ATTESTATION

		in some jdx, a notary is an officer of the court and is deemed to be a acknowledgment taker

	in NYS, you can apply to be a notary, but we don’t have the UPC notary swap rule

	pretty much anything you write will count if you intended it to be your signature

		whether the person has used that signature before is meaningful

	PA allows completely unattested wills

		studies were done.  no problems

	EXAM: do we really need witnesses for wills? POLICY QUESTION

	conditional wills are a terrible idea

		but generally, per eaton, courts allow them to be probated

	A will must be written, but need not be written on paper

		very rarely, a nuncupative will is probated in some jdx

	Preprinted will forms are terrible

		they’re meant to be attested wills, not holographic

		you gotta get them witnessed, or else they’re in a mucky middle zone

		in jdx that don’t allow holographic wills, they’re almost never probated except under a generous reading of the harmless error doctrine

	If you don’t treat your kids equally in your will, there will be fighting about it

	the burden of proof is on the proponent of the will, not on the contestant

		proponent must prove execution formalities were complied with


WILLS DAY 10

	KURAULT

		Evidence of "this is how i want my stuff disposed" != "i want this document to be my will"

		if you revoke the original will, all the codicils after it drop

		if you revoke a codicil, the base will stands


		DO NOT KEEP the original will around if T wants it gone

			(Thompson v Royall)

		ways to revoke a will:

			-formal will expressly revokes a prior will
			-holograph expressly revokes
			-new F/H will displaces old will
			-by act

	Thompson v Royall

		-not attested, so not formal
		-not completely in her handwriting, so not holographic

		-not destroyed or defaced, so not revoked by act

		most jdx require that a ‘null and void’ writing on the face must touch some words of the will

		back of back cover does not constitute part of the will.  written on some scrap paper does not count

		whether or not the cancellation touches any of the words matters

		imperfect revocation by physical act?  UPC harmless error rule does not apply

		UPC harmless error rule only applies to writing


	STOKER

		EXAM FACT PATTERN

		successful businessman, had dyslexia

		revocable trusts are a will substitute used these days to avoid probate

			-you set it up
			-put in the terms
			-title your assets in the name of the revocable trust

			but

			sometimes shit gets left behind

			so

			you execute a pour over will

				POW: appoints a personal representative, maybe a few gifts, pours your probate assets into trust
						then the trust takes over

		send them home with a

		“conformed copy”

		not a photocopy

		original signed by testator where T would normally sign

		this version allows the T to know he doesn’t have the original or anything like it

		a writing can revoke a trust.  it doesn’t have to be in a will or meet the requirements for revoking a will

	Harrison v Bird

		duplicate originals

		someone else can destroy a will for you, but it has to be at your direction and in your presence

		A photocopy of a will is almost always worthless.  invalid.  presumed destroyed and revoked if not original.

		a valid H will can be marked up validly

		the contents of a HW need not be made all on the same day.


WILLS DAY 11

		DRR: Dependent Relative Revocation

			revocation of all or part of a will is ineffective if revocation is based on MISTAKE

			mistake negates T’s revocatory intent

				1) will 1
				2) will 2

					if you kill will 2, but did so because of some mistaken belief, will 2 is resurrected

			DRR does not go back and grab will 1 and bring it back to life

			but DRR is based on the preference of testacy over intestacy, so it brings back will 2

	LaCroix v Senecal

		chick tries to execute a codicil to update a will to reflect the legal name instead of the nickname of the beneficiary

			-aside:  spouse of an interested party can’t witness

			-another:  no residue of the residue rule

		court applies DRR and grabs the first will despite the failure of the codicil

		this change was unnecessary.  nicknames are fine.

		there can be a holographic codicil to a typewritten attested will

		you can have a handwritten attested codicil or will

		partial revocation by physical act:

			some states allow, some don’t

			if the state doesn’t allow it, then it’s as if the strike through isn’t there at all

			if the state allows it, then that portion of the will is struck

		Body Heat:  Turnipseed cannot recommend this strongly enough

	In re Estate of Alburn

		she wants will number one, but we can’t give her will one.  so her choices are intestacy and will 2.  given that choice, she presumably preferred testacy over intestacy.

		Revival

			UPC

				if will 2 revokes will 1, and then will 2 is revoked by act, the previous will remains revoked.

				if will 2 partially revokes will 1, and will 2 is revoked, will 1 is revived

		Revocation by operation of law

			if you get divorced (and some states require a written settlement), it kills the spouse’s benefits under the will

			but

			how about the non-probate assets (insurance, 401k, etc…)

			UPC says divorce revokes all governing instruments

				Gov Inst: pretty much everything.  deed, will, trust, policy, pay-on-death designations, etc

		BEST PRACTICE:  go in and change all of the beneficiaries beforehand

		pretermitted spouse statutes

			event of will, marriage, death

			will does not mention spouse

			what happens to the will?

				there’s always the elective share

				the pretermitted spouse doctrine revokes a will that you wrote before you married

		pretermitted child statutes

			will, child, death

			will does not mention kids

			what happens?

				these statutes will revoke your will on your behalf because they assume you just forgot to update yr will


		Integration doctrine

			this seeks to determine what documents count as part of the will

			all papers present and intended to be part are treated as part of the will

		in re estate of Rigsby

			second page unsigned, found near will, contradicts the will in some respects

		incorporation by reference:

			the document must be in existence at the time of the will

		TPP memo: tangible personal property memorandum

		NY DOES NOT HAVE INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

		republication by codicil

			execute a will 2000, execute a codicil 2010.  whole will is deemed executed 2010

			TPP memo, execute a will 2000 which incorporates by ref, change TPP memo.  memo zapped.

		TPP memo, execute a will 2000 which incorporates by ref, change TPP memo, execute a codicil. memo saved.

		UPC:  exists when will is executed, language of will manifests intent to incorporate and describes memo good

		UPC allows incorporation by reference, like most states

			-must predate will
			-must be described precisely by will
			-will must show intent to incorporate

		Clark v Greenhalge

			some farm picture

		Acts of independent significance

			you cannot cite to a future act in your will

			‘I give 500 bucks to everyone who is employed in my business at my death.’

			baseline:  NOT VALID

				big exception: Acts of independent significance

				if the future act has meaning on its own outside of your testamentary intent, they let it in

					they’re trying to prevent will changes without formalities

					they don’t want you to say:

						I keep a letter in my desk with names of people who get 500 bucks

					they will allow 500 to each employee

						because it’s an act of independent sig, not just to decide who gets what

						it’s in your control, but you decide on other reasons

					they will allow 500 to whatever charitable trust B sets up in his will

						it’s out of your control, you can’t tweak your will without formalities

					There’s also a safe/safety deposit box exception


WILLS DAY 12

		contracts to make a will, incapacity, contests

		a contract relating to a will must be in writing (to comply with the statute of frauds)

			because oral testimony is inevitably one-sided because death

		caregivers sometimes get boned, sometimes they can get quantum merit against the estate

		BEST PRACTICE:  no contracts related to wills

	CAPACITY AND UNDUE INFLUENCE

			these happen all the time.  very common

		indelicate but lawful persuasion v.	undue influence

		eccentric peculiarities of old age	v. 	true mental infirmity

		juries are often happy to overturn a will that they see as unfair

			this includes wills that involve an “unnatural disposition”

			unnatural disposition used to mean gifts to non-spouse lovers

		the family will almost always challenge these in order to block that bitch

		juries will find against these based on value judgements and NOT LAW

	MENTAL CAPACITY

		“We allow weird people to execute wills in this country.”  -Prof Turnipseed

		BAR EXAM:  a crazy person can execute will as long as he was lucid at the time of creation of will

		POSSIBLE Q: deathbed will, trust, + marriage:  marriage is valid, will is valid, trust is invalid

			or: marriage is valid, will invalid, trust invalid

		sometimes witnesses later want to claim that they didn’t mean what they said.
		a self-proving affidavit puts the witnesses in a bind. they perjured themselves by executing the first document

		proponent:  people trying to get the will probated
		contestants: people trying to show [lack of mental capacity / insane delusion]

		once the burden has shifted, it’s hard to overcome

		the person with whatever burden, loses

		If you’re drafting a doc for someone you expect might be challenged later:

			have a conversation with T in front of witnesses that shows how sound of mind T is

			they get some security and they have a reference point for testimony later on

		practice:  always ask for a jury trial if you’re looking to overturn a will

			juries overturn dispositions to same sex partners

	INSANE DELUSIONS

		you can be perfectly competent in every way, but if you hold ONE REALLY WEIRD VIEW and it causes you to change your disposition, the will can be overturned

			1- T had insane delusion (this means NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE DELUSION)
			2- WILL was a product of the insane delusion (see note on 282)

		In almost all states that allow holographs, A DATE IS REQUIRED in addition to the signature requirement

WILLS DAY 13

	durable power of attorney:  good the moment its signed

	EXAM road map for who has BoP

	1- the proponents of a will always have the initial burden of proving the will (that formalities were followed)

	2- contestant alleging UI must show:

			-confidential relationship
				-fiduciary
				-reliant
				-dominant/subservient
			-suspicious circumstances (290-291)
				-weakened
				-wrongdoer participated
				- independent advice
				-secrecy or haste
				-changes in donor’s attitudes or behaviors
				-intuition

	3- burden flips back to proponents

			-proponent must disprove his or her undue influence

	WHOEVER HAS THE ULTIMATE BURDEN OF PERSUASION ALMOST ALWAYS LOSES

	BEST PRACTICE:  use a revocable trust instead of a will in these kinds of situations

		title as much as you can in the name of the trust
			 (starts the statute of limitations running before death)
		people won’t challenge a trust while the person is living
		you start getting the trust wound up with 3rd parties, it can’t be undone

	YOU DON’T SEE UNDUE INFLUENCE CASES WITH REVOCABLE TRUSTS

	almost no one has standing to challenge an adoption, only bio parents usually

	BEST PRACTICE:  put the bitching in a separate document, not the will

		the will is a public document
			this could bring on a challenge not on disposition, but on name clearing
			testamentary libel is a thing (target can sue the estate)
		the attorney should hold on to the letter just in case

		regardless, make sure that shit is accurate

	in TX, contestants have the additional burden of showing causation on top of confidential relationship and SC

	If you’re related to the person whose will you’re drafting, do not take more than you would under intestacy

		it automatically raises an assumption of wrongdoing, which you have to rebut

	DO NOT DRAFT YOURSELF MORE THAN YOU WOULD GET ANYWAYS

	DON’T EVER DRAFT A WILL FOR AN UNRELATED PERSON WHERE YOU TAKE REAL MONEY

		you will get challenged and you will lose and you might lose your license

	Common Law Marriage is going away

	it’s ok to appoint yourself as executor, but you have to suggest the list of people other than yourself first

		they have to come up with the idea on their own

		you also need to make a letter afterwards indicating that you have written yourself in

			then the dude writes back saying he understood the other choices and chose you anyhow

	BEST PRACTICE:  don’t bother with a no-contest clause

	Warning signs for possible will challenges:

		-radical departure from prior longstanding Estate Planning
		-multiple/blended families
		-conditions on bequests
		-gift to mistresses or other people unpopular with family/heirs
		-unequal shares to kin of equal relation


WILLS DAY 14

	false representations == fraud

	undue influence

	physical force == duress

	fraud

		causation is the tricky thing

		the fraud must be the cause of the change

		if the bastard was gonna do it anyhow, not fraud

	tortious intereference with an expectancy

		elements:

			1) existence of an expectancy
			2) intentional interference with exp through tortious conduct
			3) causation
			4) damages

			an expectancy now includes probate and nonprobate assets

		this is tort, has nothing to do with the estate

			is not filed in probate court

			you can get into federal court if you meet the other qualifications

			and youve exhausted your administrative remedies

		UI, duress, or fraud

	THIS IS BADLY CRITICIZED AS BEING A "SECOND BITE FROM THE APPLE"

		this allows punitive damages too

	you don't have to give notice to the old stooge when you execute a new PoA

	you do have to give notice to any interested party in order to probate a will

		-heirs
		-beneficiaries
		-beneficiaries of prior wills

	it's very hard to reopen a probate proceeding for any reason

	you cannot bring a tortious interference claim with mental capacity as a pillar

	CONSTRUCTION OF WILLS

		plain meaning given effect or let extrinsic evidence in?

		classic view: no reforming a will due to ambiguity or mistake

		update: patent and latent ambiguity distinction

			most states still recognize the difference

			patent is an inconsistency on the face of the doc (1/2 to A, 1/2 to B, 1/2 to C)

				no extrinsic evidence for patent ambiguity in most states

				(if you see a problem in the 4 corners of the will, no ext ev)

			latent ambiguity is an inconsistency not visible on the 4 corners

				extrinsic evidence is permitted here conventionally

				(1 million to Danny, 3 lovers named Danny)
				(my horse to my nephew joe, 2 horses and 3 joes)

		The restatement and others tries to do away with the distinction between patent and latent


WILLS DAY 15

		NONREFORMATION guards against a false positive (fake-ass finding of mistake)

		REFORMATION prevents false negatives (preventing T's obvious intent b/c of formalism)

	SECRET REFORMATION:

		unambigous terms == no extrinsic evidence

		ambiguous terms on the face == ex ev allowed

		many jdx still have black letter law that prevent reformation for mistake

			some courts stick to it and really dont reform

			others will torque the hell out of law or facts to fix the error


	GIBBS:

		we're dealing with both wills because X didnt survive Y by more than 60 days

		both wills named a dude who lived at an address

			NO PATENT AMBIGUITY

			the guy had the middle initial and lived at the address

		but there's this other guy, and

			they're friends with him and

			the other guy was listed in prior wills

		they really meant to give the gift to the other guy

		the court first claims they're not empowered to fix it

			then, they eliminate an initial to make it ambiguous

			now that it's ambiguous they can use ex ev to construe

			they're satisfied that there's clear and convincing evidence

		THE COURT CLAIMS TO "CONSTRUE" THE IDENTITY

		OPENLY REFORMING FOR MISTAKE


			UPC:  allows reformation where clear and convincing evidence

				[GOVERNING INSTRUMENT: term of art.  means pretty much everything.  deed, will, trust, policy, pay-on-death designations, etc.

				UPC position is still minority

		COURTS ROUTINELY ALLOW FOR REFORMATION IN ORDER TO CAPTURE THE TAX BENEFITS THAT THE ORIGINAL INSTRUMENT SOUGHT TO CAPTURE

		STALE WILLS

			shit happens between execution and death

				beneficiaries might die
				classes can grow
				T's property changes

			FUNDAMENTAL RULE: lapsed or void devise:  no takey

				its a lapse if A dies before you

				its void if A was dead at the execution, or was a dog

					they have the SAME RULES, BUT DIFFERENT NAMES

			Specific bequests lapse into RRR

				if no RRR, then passes by intestacy

			General bequests lapse into RRR

				if no RRR, then passes by intestacy

			RRR lapses into intestacy (if RRR was only to one heir)

			RRR lapses partially into intestacy (if RRR was to more than one heir)  EXAM

				if jdx uses no residuary of a residuary:

					RRR to A and B 50% each

					A dies
					B gets 50% of RRR
					A's share passes by intestacy

				if jdx has abandoned no R of R:

					RRR to A and B 50% each

					A dies
					B gets 100% of RRR

		Class Gifts:

			A, B, C get a class gift

			A dies

			B and C split A's share


		ROXY IS A DOG, SO THE GIFT IS VOID

			best practice:  any gift that fails bc lapsed or void will augment proportionately the other gifts under the instrument

			coulda argued: abandon the no R of R rule

				bc then roxy's share would pass to Quinn


			write in contingencies for dead beneficiaries, changed property, etc

				it saves you from dealing with state law


			under no circumstances will a beneficiary of a void gift have representation in a probate proceeding


WILLS DAY 16

	EXAM

		ANTILAPSE

			make sure, before you do an antilapse analysis, that the testator did not make a statement that prevents operation of the antilapse statute

			antilapse statutes only apply to family, generally

			majority rule:  "If A survives me" blocks the operation of the antilapse statute

			minority and UPC:  "If A survives me" is boilerplate language, does not block ALS

				under the minority rule, you have to give a redirect (if A predeceases me, to B)

				under minority rule, boilerplate does not block antilapse


		EXAM

			ANTILAPSE ANALYSIS PROCEDURE:

				-scope: is predeceased beneficiary within the protected class? (is A family?)
				-lineage:  does beneficiry have surviving lineal descendants?
				-text:  is there expression of contrary intent in the will? ("if she survives me, else )

			minority no residue of residue:

				a lapsed [portion of a] gift falls into intestacy

			majority rule:

				a lapsed [portion of a] gift falls into RRR (if there's a second RRR beneficiary)


			BEST PRACTICE:

				to A if A survives me, but if A does not survive me, to B if B survives me.  If both A and B both do not survive me, to be added to the residue of my estate

					(this leaves no ambiguity left for state law to handle.  you hit all the points)


		CLASS GIFTS:

			a class gift is a gift to those who TAKE AS MEMBERS OF A GROUP and SHARES ARE DYNAMIC

			it's presumed to be a class gift if the benes are IDd by a term of relationship

			NOT A CLASS GIFT IF:

				benes are IDd by their names and the SHARES ARE FIXED


					BEST PRACTICE FOR PASSING DOWN FAMILY FARM:

						put it in an LLC
						give each kid a share of the equity
						put the smartest kid in charge of the LLC


	DAWSON

		"to my nephews" would create a class gift

		names and fixed percentages create a specific gift


			since it was specific and it failed (he predeceased)

			it passes by RRR or INT


			Analysis:

				-scope:  predeceased is not within the protected class (he is a nephew, but not blood)
				the rest doesnt matter because he failed the first step


			this is probably not what T wanted (she mentioned she wanted it to go to her husband's fam)

			but that's the law.  her fam will now force the sale and the H's fam will lose the farm.


		MAJORITY:

			a class gift to a single generation: ALS applies
			a class gift across generations:  ALS does not apply

		MINORITY:

			ALS applies to both


		ADEMPTION

			what happens when your car predeceases you?

				-A gets nothing
				-A gets the value of the car
				-PR compelled to go buy a 2011 Honda Element, and give it to A
				-A gets whatever car T was driving at death


			IDENTITY THEORY: minority

				old shcool way:

				if you can identify it, then they get it
				if you cannot identify it in the estate, A gets nothing

				Exceptions to ID theory:

					see page 380 and 381

				NY is an ID theory state


			INTENT THEORY: majority

				replacement property swaps in to fill the role of the devise
				if there's no replacement, A gets the value of the thing


		SATISFACTION

			OPERATES LIKE ADVANCEMENT IN INTESTACY

			you give someone 10k in your will
			before you die but after execution, you give the guy 5k

			under common law, it was automatically subtracted out

				now, maj and UPC require a contemporaneous writing
				therefore the doctrine almost never applies

			This only applies to general gifts, not specific gifts

		EXONERATION OF LIENS

			if you leave someone a house with a lien on it

			does the estate have to pay off the lien

			or do you take subject to the lien?

			generally, it's answered by asking if the T was personally liable

				they almost always are

			if you are personally liable, then the UPC and MAJ say YOU TAKE SUBJECT TO THE LIEN

			old common law and minority: liens paid from residuary before the gift is made


			BEST PRACTICE:

				ask the client.  do you want your kids to pay it off out of the RRR?


		ABATEMENT

			operates like bankruptcy

			if you make lots of specific and general gifts, but you dont have that much property

			IT GOES LIKE THIS:

				RRR abates first
				GEN gifts abates next
				SPC gifts and demonstrative gifts abate next

			PRO RATA reduction reduces each share proportionately



			how about when a PoA sells off an asset that T had devised?

				Anton answers this at length

				if T knew of the sale, and it was voluntary, it's adeemed

					(residuary takers get leftover funds from sale of duplex)

				if T did not act voluntarily

					(specific devisee takes leftover funds from sale)


WILLS DAY 17


	TRUST INTRO

		Trustee holds the trust corpus in his own name.

		banks insured by FDIC have to report their assets to the federal reserve

		trusts have to file 1041 forms

		HUGE amounts of money are held in trust currently


	UTC (2000) is newer than UPC

		50% adopted, but not always the same thing

		no silent trusts under UTC, so states did not incorporate those provisions

		NY has not adopted.  intentionally behind the times.

		SD NV AK DE are major trust jdx

			most of all wealth in all trusts are in one of those states

			they're in an arms race to see who can be the most trust-friendly

				theyve mostly killed RAP

				and income tax on trust assets

				and enacted domestic asset protections trust legislation

			NV did away with the last of the creditor's rights

				even if youre seeking child support, you can't get to those assets
				this brought in a TON of dough
				NV success lowered the moral bar

				SD followed suit, try to attract settlors


	Since there's so much money at play, fiduciary duties are being taken way seriously

		suing a fiduciary is becoming the biggest money part of the game from the lawyers' side

		trustee litigation is the new big deal



	FUNCTIONS OF A TRUSTEE

		1- custodial
		2- administrative
		3- investment
		4- distribution


		custodial:

			if you're the trustee and the building burns down, you're personally liabe if uninsured

		administrative:

			accounting for the transactions, sending annual reports and tax returns

		investment:

			beneficiaries care most about this

			trustees get better dough if they invest well too

		distribution:

			most are discretionary in this respect

			beneficiaries always want more distributions

			but trustee gets lower fees that way

				plus it puts him in a vulnerable place vis a vis the "remaindermen"



		Traditionally, these responsibilities went to one person

			pros are good at 1,2 and maybe 3 but very bad at 4 bc they don't know the family

			amateurs typically distribute better bc they know the family

				but they're almost always not as good at custodial, admin, and investment responsibilities


		The modern trend is to split these responsibilities up

			directed trust: trust company takes on custodial and admin functions, and sometimes investment

				but they encourage you to draft in a distribution committee made up of friends and family

				the committee makes decisions about who gets what each year

				this protects the trustee from suit

			another common arrangement is to allow your normal investment advisor to take over investment

				big trust companies are happy because this is the second most common suit after distribution


	NY is the worst jdx in the country to set up a trust


	A legal life estate is a terrible idea

		especially compared to a trust

		instead of using fiduciary law, you have to go directly to the waster with common law

			the english have zapped it completely



	Mutual funds are set up as business trusts

		that's not what we talk about

		they have a different body of law

		we're dealing with PERSONAL TRUSTS



	CREATION OF A TRUST

		1- intent to create a trust
		2- ascertainable beneficiaries
		3- specific property (res)
		4- [sometimes] writing [if land or will]


		Ascertainable benes

			You can set up a valid trust for the benefit of unborn children
			they're not alive yet, but we know who they are
			the court can even appoint a guardian ad litem to protect the interest of the unborns

			ascertainable != born

			it can also be an incomplete class (to my children)

		Specific property

			most jdx require it to be a non-nominal amount
			fund it with ten bucks, not one buck

			it doesn't have to be cash or tangible property

				it can be intellectual property
				it can be TPP
				it can be a future interest

		WRITING

			bar favorite
			you CAN have an oral trust
				there's proof issues associated, but if you can prove it, its valid
			but they can't have land in them
			and they cant be testamanetary


	Intent to create a trust

		you don't have to use the word trust to make one
		just because you did use the word doesn't mean it is a trust


	a trust will never fail for lack of a trustee

		the court steps in to appoint one if needed
		its the executor if testamentary trust


	Jimenez

		grandma gives a few gifts, tells dad theyre for the education of the grandkids

		dad (trustee) cashes them in and pools them together

		he registers himself as the custodian

			that means he's not a trustee, but less

			he's claiming to be ruled by UGMA, not trust law

				UTMA is the new version

					under UTMA, it's not a real trust

					it's a different body of law

				he'd prefer to be custodian instead of trustee

					bc he's less obligated that way

					he doesn't have to account to beneficiaries

					it can be spent "for the benefit" generally (very broad)

					trustees are much more restricted than that

					there's also a SoL issue baked in here

						as trustee he'd be obligated to give an accounting

						ACCOUNTING: list of all the transactions and a statement as to how much dough

						if it's a real trust and you never give an account, the SoL never starts to run

						they can come back and teg you way later

							pros want to give accountings because it insulates a period of time

						if it's UGMA or UTMA, then you only have until age of MAJ and change to sue

					IF this was UGMA/UTMA, then kid could not sue dad

				The court, though, ruled that it was a trust

			The judge knew what was happening and likely handled his own case

			The kid had to handle a lawyer

				her fees probably ate her win

				things had probably gotten seriously ugly prior to this suit


	YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ACCEPT A TRUSTEE POSITION IF YOU DON'T WANT IT

		it might not be a good place to dabble in

		if youre an attorney and you take on a fiduciary duty

			YOUR NORMAL MALPRACTICE COVERAGE DOES NOT REACH

			if you represent a fiduciary, youre covered

			but if you get the fiduciary fee, you need to buy a rider to your policy

		Before you accept a fid role, add some coverage with a low deductible

		even an LLC might not protect, especially if youre the only fella

			an S corporation might be better

			best is just to get coverage

		Once you accept, you can't just resign

			unless there's a provision in the trust, you gotta get an OK from court

			most well drafted trust have a resignation feature

				but even then its a hassle



		INTENT for trusts is NOT intent for the benes to have the stuff

			it's intent to create a trust


	HEBREW UNIV v NYE

		there's a lot of evidence that she wanted to give the books to the U

		but it's not evidence that makes it seem like she thought she was fiduciary

		the evidence of the case gets to whether she made an inter vivos gift

			writing is symbolic delivery
			keys are constructive delivery

		guy tries to bind his estate to pay $200 per month

			you could try to argue that it's a holographic codicil

			"bind my estate" cuts in favor, inter alia

			this court doesnt accept it

		the real argument was that his letter created a trust

			but, there was no specific res

			he didnt fund the trust

				the court refused to imply the amount in the "trust"

				you either have to say "all my property" or some specific measure

				THE TRUST PROPERTY MUST BE SEPARATED FROM THE REST

				10% of my estate would have worked

			RESULTING TRUST: it's a remedy.  we take [a whole estate] and put it in trust.  after the purpose is met, it results back to the settlor or the beneficiaries or the heirs.  bar.

			people set up trusts for property that is going to come into being in the future.
			(tax dodging strategy)
			"future profits from my existing protfolio" would have worked
			but the way he arranged it, it was for his future acquisitions and their profits
			this is not an ascertainable res

			a future interest in property is a vested interest and can be transferred this way



		ASCERTAINABLE BENEFICIARIES

		CLARK v CAMPBELL

			guy bequeaths all his knick knacks to his trustees to distribute to his friends

			the [residuary] beneficiaries under his will would take if this trust is invalid

			they first argue it's not a trust

				C/A: he put specific items, he said "trustees", maybe it is a trust

				A: "friends" is unascertainable by law.  no valid bequest to an indefinite person

			the remedy was a resulting trust


			difference between trust and Power of Appointment

				trust: To A as trustee, to distribute to my friends {FAILS}
				PoA: To A, to distribute among my friends {VALID}

				If you want to do something stupid like this, use a PoA, not a trust.
				PoA's can have unascertainable beneficiaries

				Did Lee Strasberg have a General or Specific PoA?
					General.  He could give it to himself, his estate, his creditors, and his estate's creditors. Exam.


		SEARIGHT'S ESTATE

			trust for a dog trixie

			guy bequeaths his dog to a woman.  no prob.

			next:

				guy instructs to use $1000 (res)
				to a trustee florence
				to use $.75 a day to care for the dog (fiduciary duties)

					ANIMAL TRUSTS:

						x to unidentified animals = charitable trust. valid.  not an estate tax deduction though.
						x to my dog[s] = invalid. best you could hope for was an honorary trust.

						common law:  pet trusts are at best honorary trusts

							the trustee does not actually have to live up to the duty
								the settlor or his estate would have standing if the trustee doesnt live up to it
								the remedy is to impose a resulting trust.  the trustee holds the dough for [x]

							the trust has to comply with the RAP
								animals cannot be a validating life
								they almost always failed for this

						UTC: majority of states have adopted pet trust statutes

							it lets off on the RAP strictness

				The court saves the gift with a non compliant RAP analysis


		LEONA HELMSLEY

			bitch leaves her dog millions
			other beneficiaries are pissed
			go to surrogates
			quick settlement
			court reduces the amount for the dog

		Honorary trusts have usually been for care of gravestones

			specified graves:
				not charitable
				violates RAP most likely

			graves in an area:
				charitable
				survives

			UTC now allows purpose trusts so long as theyre not capricious


		Oral trusts are historically very hard to prove
				typically it's one person claiming a trust for their benefit
				and the settlor is dead
				C&C evidence is usually required


		Secret and Semisecret trusts. See p 431 and Olliffe handout.


		IN RE FOURNIER

			Land and Testamentary trusts historically require a writing


WILLS DAY 19


	THE LAW OF REVOCABLE TRUSTS

		largely replaced wills


		BP: get a revocable trust notarized

			if you're making a whole estate plan, have everything witnessed and notarized


		because theyre not compliant with wills act formalities, people wonder

			are they valid as will substitutes?


		Most people opt out of probate by means of:

			-401k
			-revocable trust
			-life insurance
			-IRA

				401k rolls into IRA, typically
				employers issue life insurance policies on employees

			-cars (jointly titled)
			-house (jointly titled)
			-business

			-sole name accounts get POD/TOD designations


			VERY LITTLE OF WHAT PEOPLE OWN IS HELD IN THEIR OWN NAMES, w/o POD designations


				the designations become stale or dispersed


			THE RESULT IS A BIG MIX, NO COMPREHENSIVE PLAN


		BEST PRACTICE:

			make a revocable trust with your preferences written into it

			make your revocable trust the beneficiary of all these things

			that way, when you change one thing, it automatically changes all the rest


		WHO CAN BRING SUIT ON A REVOCABLE TRUST:

			FACTS:

				A is settlor
				A is trustee
				A is lifetime beneficiary
				B&C are beneficiaries on A's death (residuary beneficiaries)
				D is successor trustee

			B and C can't sue while A lives

			if D loots the money while trustee (bc A is incapacitated)

				in some jdx, B and C can sue
				in some jdx, they can't

			FACTS:

				A is settlor
				D is trustee
				A is lifetime beneficiary
				B&C are beneficiaries on A's death (residuary beneficiaries)

			Absent something weird, if A still has capacity

				A is the only one who can go after D for bad behavior

			if A loses capacity,

				sometimes B and C can go after D, sometimes not


		REVOKING AND AMENDING A REVOCABLE TRUST

			absent specification, C/L:

				presumption of 'irrevocable'

			absent specification, UTC:

				presumption of 'revocable'


		PATTERSON v PATTERSON


			B is trustee
			Residuary to B&C originally
			C is written out of the trust
				by written amendment

			C objects that settlor didn't use the right procedure to amend

			however, the terms of the trust did not stipulate an exclusive method

			BP: deliver update to the trustee
			commonly: a person is his own trustee
			BP: write an exclusive method, so you can be sure the right people get the amendment


		REVOCATION BY WRITING:

			D writes a will subsequent to a revocable trust, mentions the trust specifically

				effective to amend/revoke

			You can expressly revoke it

			OR

			You can revoke it by implication

				if you give away everything the old documents dealt with
				that scrubs out the old document

			A will's residuary clause beats out a trust


		REVOCATION BY ACT:

			you can revoke by act unless the trust specifies an exclusive method for revoking


		SUBSIDIARY LAW OF WILLS

			UTC APPLIES TO GOVERNING INTSTRUMENTS

				UTC is slick about this
				but state laws are not


	STATE STREET BANK AND TRUST v REISER

		guy owns some companies
		titles the stock in the name of the revocable trust
			not to avoid creditors, though
				that would be a fraudulent conveyance
				there's civil and criminal penalties
		guy applies for a loan
		loan officer gives him a loan because of "the cut of his jib"
			"who needs collateral when you've got a good jib cut?" -TT
		bad shit happens, guy's estate has no dough to pay back loan
		they go after him personally

			CAN THEY GET AT THE REVOCABLE TRUST TO GET PAID BACK?

				[a revocable trust becomes an irrevocable trust on settlor's death]

				IRS: a revoacble trust during life counts as "owned" at your death
					it's taxable in the estate tax, etc

			YES.  state treet can reach the trust assets.


		in some jdx, creditors must drain probate assets before they go to the trust


		1- is nonprobate property subject to creditors only if probate inadequate?
		2- exemptions of probate property apply? homestead?
		2- family allowance?
		3- go after PR or go directly against those with the nonprobate assets?
		4- if ben asset sued, can she recover from other np beneficiaries?
		5- SoL filing creditor claims


		There are varying degrees to which the elective share can reach non-probate assets.
			UPC: most but not all
			NY: most but not all
			some: you can't get to them, easy way to beat elective share

			what if you live in NY and set up a trust in georgia (state with no elective share)?

				georgia trustee

				HAS NOT BEEN TESTED


	CLYMER v MAYO

		she sets up a will
		a beneficiary designation LI
		and a beneficiary designation on 403b

		it was all gonna go to her husband

		she changed some of the designations away from her husband

		one slipped through the cracks
			the revocable trust, she did not change

			james was still income benficiary
			some univiersities were residuary beneficiaries

		does the divorce revocation law from wills apply here?

			if it was a will, it'd be revoked

			the results are all over the map

		in MA, statutory language declared the auto-revoaction applicable only to wills

		the court waves the magic wand

		and now the law applies to revocable trusts too

		Pour-Over Will

			xr the handout

		Lifetime Consequences of a Revocable Trust

			-your stuff gets managed by a pro
			-your property is handled as soon as you're incapacitated
			-keeps title clear

				there is no tax benefit though, but no harm done

		After Death Consequences of a Revocable Trust

			-avoidance of probate
			-continuity of mgmt
			-privacy
			-more difficult to contest/overturn
			-more choice of law

				there's uncertainty about subsidiary law of wills, though
				the nonclaim statute may not apply, for example

		The Hassle of Retitling

			it has to happen at some point anyway
			retitle it during life, rather than after death

			[GIFT TAX is always paid by the donor]



		DEATH INSURANCE aka LIFE INSURANCE

			TWO TYPES:  term and whole

				TERM LIFE:

					PURE TERM INSURANCE is for one year.  you make a contract with the company.  'if i die, you pay person B a million dollars.'

					LEVEL PREMIUM TERM INSURANCE sets a std premium.  you pay the same amount despite the fact that your likelihood of death increases. usually end around 70.

					These are good as actual insurance against a premature death.  No surrender value.

				WHOLE LIFE:

					costs more each year than term.

					a portion is used to pay for your term insurance for that year.

					the rest goes into an investment fund

					the fund is used when you're old to pay for the costs above your premiums to insure your life

					TWO TYPES:

						GUARANTEED:  no matter what your investments fund earns, we will pay up when you die.  costs more.  they choose your investments.

						NON-GUARANTEED:  policyholder takes the risk.  if the market crashes, and your investment pool dries up, the insurance ends.  costs less.  you can choose your investments.

			Life Insurance grows untaxed.  It's disbursed untaxed too.  It's sellable, usable as collateral.


		COOK v EQUITABLE LIFE

			FACTS:

				whole life private policy

				stopped paying

				converted to a paid up term policy

				guy divorced and remarried, but never changed the beneficiary

				he executed a valid holographic will purporting to change the beneficiary of the policy

				he dies


			Court invokes the majority rule:

				A WILL CANNOT OVERRIDE A LIFE INSURANCE DESIGNATION where the company specifies a method of change.

				[UPC would have revoked the designation on divorce bc its a governing instrument]


			This should have been handled in the settlement agreement.



		RETIREMENT PLANS

			they're funded with pre-tax dollars
			they grow income-tax free
			2/3 of family wealth is now tied up in these

			Three types:

				-pensions
				-defined contribution plans
				-individual retirement accounts

				PENSIONS aka Defined Benefit Plans

					these are mostly gone via bankruptcy

					pensions are no longer offered

				DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

					you own the account

					you pay into 401k or 403b

					it's yours and you can invest it in a number of different offers

					grows or shrinks, it's yours, employer is not on the hook

					employer matches a certain amount, and then their role is done

						[THESE FIRST TWO ARE SUBJECT TO ERISA]

				INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT

					huge amount of money here


		NUNNENMAN v ESTATE OF GRUBS

			not ERISA based

			it's an IRA

			contract required changes to be made with house forms

			he went to the hospital, faces death, drafts a will

				leaves his estate to his mother

				the will made no specfic reference to the IRA

			3 documents:
				-beneficiary designation
				-will
				-note from bible

			the IRA was designated for Jeannie, but the note sent it to mom

				not good enough

				MAJORITY RULE:

					a specific mention of a policy in a will is enough to change it for Life Insurance

			EXAM PROCESS:

			A note is either a will or it's not.

				if it is

					ask, is there a subsequent will?
					does it expressly revokes, does it feature a RRR clause?

				if its not

					then you can't overturn the designation.
					a regular writing that does not rise to the level of a will cannot change the designation

			Is "All IRA" specific enough to ID the IRA?

			Does DRR come into play?

				maybe we could bring back this 'maybe will' if he made a mistake when he executed the subsequent will



		EGELHOFF v EGELHOFF

			married couple

			guy had a company LI policy and a company retirement plan

			wife was named, no contingent beneficiaries

			if the revocation on divorce statue operates:

				we assume donna predeceases

				it falls to heirs (children from a prior marriage)

			two argentinian lovers
			fella was married to someone else
			guy titles his mistress as a joint tenant on the CMA
				CMA: cash mgmt acct.  brokerage account with checking power.
			guy gets sick, kids arrive, boot the mistress out
			she withdraws 280k
			she makes a new account with ML and deposits there
				[she shoulda gone to BoA]
				they would have refused to give the money back

		he wins at trial ct level because he had no donative intent

		Account types:

			Joint Tenancy:
				both parties have rights
				irrevocable.  o cannot unilaterally withdraw
				o cannot unilaterally close
				divorce turns it into TinC
			Agency:
				agent can draw while principle lives
				they can write checks, but get nothing on death
				requires trust, they can write full acct value checks
				revocable during O's competence
			POD:
				payable on death
				revocable, changeable any time

			Teller just gives you the JT form
			Its better for banks because its lower liability
				they don't have to worry about who dies when in a JT

		He understood the JT rules

		Majority rule:  you're presumed to have made a gift of at least 1/2 of the contents of the account when you add a person as a JT

			it's a reubttable presumption in FL (not everywhere)
			but because of the facts, he could not rebut

		UPC: net contribution rule (adopted in many states)

			if he loaded the funds, she can't clean him out
			3/4 and 1/4 split in funding = same rights to access

		IRS:

			JT with non-spouse: net contribution rule
			JT with spouse: 1/2 is presumed gift, 1/2 estate taxed

		"You gotta be careful.  Christina will clean you out." -TT


	Tenancy by the Entirety:

		only for married couples
		only in some states
			in some, it's only for real property
		stronger than JT
		dissolves to JT or TinC on divorce
		you cannot force the sale of a property
			contrasts to JT, where either party can force the sale
			A can unilaterally force it from JT to TinC
			then A can force the sale

				theyre out of style
					institutions are suspicious of them

WILLS DAY 22

	ELECTIVE SHARE
	UPC PROVISIONS
	COMMUNITY PROPERTY

	COMMUNITY PROPERTY:

		once you get married, all the money that comes in via earnings and all the property it buys is community property

		it's immediately owned automatically 1/2 and 1/2

		gifts and inheritance kept separate are separate property

			if theyre intermingled, they become community property

			what you bring to the marriage is separate too until mingled

		EXAM:  THERES NO ELECTIVE SHARE IN A COMMUNITY PROPERTY JDX

		A can devise all separate property and half the community property

	ELECTIVE SHARE

		started in NY

			elective share law has developed in an arms race with practitioners who find ways to avoid it

		NY now has a very tough separate property elective share

		AUGMENTED ESTATE:

			the pie you take the elective share out of

		it's often 1/2 if no prior marriage
		it's often 1/3 if prior marriage or kids

		most states now incorporate non probate property too

		ALSO APPLIES TO INTESTACY

			most people speak of electing against the will

			however, you can also elect over intestacy

			atty does the calculations for the client and you take whichever is higher

			EXAM: apply elective share to intestacy problems

			policy question: GA revocable trust, which law should govern?

			DELAWARE:  the augmented share is whatever the IRS says is in your gross estate

				this makes it tough to dodge the elective share, because IRS thinks of everything


		UPC ELECTIVE SHARE STATUTE

			tries to match itself to the partnership theory of marriage
			they should share regardless of who earns

			75k no matter what
			then grows the longer you're married

			EXAM ANALYSIS PROCEDURE:

				UPC augmented estate:

					-A's and B's property
					-apply the percentage from p535
					-B gets 75k plus 1/2 of step 2
					-subtract out what B has been given


	PRENUP REQUIREMENTS:

		-written and preferably notarized
		-complete and accurate financial disclosure
		-each party represented by competent and independent counsel
		-free of coercive behavior
			(can't be right before the marriage.  6 months before)
		-reasonable
			at time executed
			at time of divorce or death


	REECE v ELLIOT

		financial disclosure is the issue

		he didn't give up info about some closely held stock he owned

			IBM requires no disclosure of value (bc NYSE)
			a private company (bc not publicly available)

		court said it didnt matter bc party was not getting the assets anyhow

		executed 5 days before marriage (too close)

		high risk bc no declaration of value



	As bad as this all sounds, client's won't be super into it

		GO OFFSHORE!  Cook Islands Asset Protection Trust



WILLS PENULTIMATE CLASS

	last exam is on Bb under content

	Community property:

		if you come to the marriage or inherit, it's separate

		if you earn it while married or buy it with that money, then it's community property

		on death, A can devise all his separate property and half the community property

		B is entitled to nothing because she already owns 1/2

		PLANNING:

		moving from one kind of jdx to another

			community to separate:

				as long as they don't convert the community property, it retains its character despite a move to NY

				any earnings following the move follow separate property rules

				the elective share won't apply to the community property

				it will apply to all the stuff after the move

					the law of the situs governs real estate, though

				you can convert by contract the community property into separate property

					marriage contract, joint checking account

				or you can leave it in its community property form

					for tax advantages

					you can set up an AK trust and have it deemed community property even if you live in a separate property state

			moving from separate to community:

				FACTS:

					A is a big earner and holds the dough in his sole name
					they move to CA to retire
					no more earning, A dies
					A leaves a will leaving everything to kids from a prior marriage

				B gets NOTHING, no elective share option, nada

					some states have quasi-community property to remedy this

			quasi-community property:

				separate property is treated as if its community property

				as long as it would have been treated as community property if it had been earned in the new jdx

			community property held solely in A's name cannot be sold unilaterally by A

				this protects the Bs of the world


	Miscellaneous Marriage Rights:

		IRAs are not subject to ERISA

			you can roll some plans under some circumstances into an IRA to avoid erisa

		CURTESY AND DOWER

			only relevance is for real prperty, only applies to RP

			a separate property jdx that still has dower requires both signatures to sell a property even if it's in A's sole name

			it protects the Bs of the world


	OMISSION

		Intentional omission:

			you can disinhereit a kid
			they get no elective share except in Louisiana
			but even LA has a set of exceptions

				-child has hit parent
				-child has been cruel
				-failed to communicate for two years
				-etc

		Unintentional omission of a spouse:

			the omitted spouse doctrine assumes that you forgot to update your will if you got married and didnt change it

				you can beat it by making wills both before and after that mention the marriage

			PRESTIE

				guy has a revocable trust and a pourover will

				son was beneficiary

				no provision made for on-again-off-again wife

				he updates the trust to give w a LE in the condo

				he dies

				she wants more than just the LE

				she sues to get more under the omitted spouse doctrine

				she wants the will revoked to the extent she was "shorted" so she can get her intestate share

				the court knows he DID account for her

				but because the statute is inflexible and only says "will"

				they let her get an intestate share on top of her LE


		Pretermitted Children

			Will, then kid, then death

			the law assumes you would certainly have left something to your kids

			GRAY v GRAY

				john makes a will leaving everything to mary

				they divorce, will is auto-revoked

				jack sues for his intestate share

				EXAM FACT PATTERN

				know antilapse and especially NO RESIDUE OF RESIDUE RULE

				T had kids when the will was executed and left all his estate to the omitted child's [jack's] mom

					this is an anomolous application of the AL statute

WILLS FINAL CLASS

	Fiduciary duties

		especially trustee's duties

		old way: you only had those powers that were enumerated in the doc

		classic tension:  giving the trustee broad powers v safguarding the beneficiaries

		modern solution: default broad powers subject to fiduciary duties

			they have extremely broad powers as a modern trustee unless the doc restricts you otherwise

			the restrictions come from fiduciary law now

		if you breach one of your fiduciary duties, mad litigation

		S815 UPC gives you the powers at once
		S816 UPC enumerates the powers to facilitate transactions

			most pracitioners still list everything

			it's easier to get a bank to open a trust account if you have a one liner in your doc that enumerates the power of [opening a checking account]

		THIRD PARTIES:

			used to be they had a duty to inquire as to the legality of the action the trustee was trying to do

				RE broker had a duty to look into the trust

				this slowed down the process and reqd court intervention

			now, no duty to inquire

				this allows third parties to be more comfy in dealing with fiduciaries without having to run it past general counsel

		POWERS v DUTIES

			some trustee might have the power to do a thing, but that's separate from the duty inquiry

			you can have the power to do a thing

			and still violate your duty if you did it badly

			two step inquiry:

				-does truste have the power to do it?
					this is almost always yes now
				-did they breach a duty when they used that power?
					this is where the litigation is at now

		CHARITABLE TRUSTS

			private trusts can be set up for human beneficiaries
			or
			for a charitable purpose

			if you have a charitable trust, the person in charge of enforcing the fiduc duty is the atty general of the state

			sometimes the settlor, if still living, can allege a breach of fiduc duty

			ATTY GENERAL must get involved to remedy a breach of fiduc duty for a charitable trust

			at any given time, there's tens of thousands that need attention

			they'd do noting else if they really had to handle it all

			POLICY ISSUE? EXAM?


		HARTMAN v HARTLE

			decedent leaves a will naming the son in laws as executors
				this is rare and harsh, probably pissed kids off

			will says to sell all RE and distribute proceeds

			they sold some

			at issue is the farm

			this piece got sold in a sham transaction to give it to one of the executors to sell

			law would collapse that sham transaction

			NO SELF DEALING RULE

				you cant make a sweet deal to advance your own interests as a fiduc

				you can't make any self deal as a fiduciary

					self dealing = ITS OVER

					no further inquiry rule

				if you engage in self dealing, you've violated your duty

			REMEDIES

				hold trustee liable for the profit made (this case)
				compel trustee to return the property (if purchase from trust)
				repay purchase price and take back property (if sale from trust)

			the property here had been sold to a BFP

				therefore BFP gets to keep property and trustee has to pay up


			BONDING

				if youre a PR or a trustee, state law often requires you to get a fidcuiary bond from an insurance company (EXPENSIVE 25%)

				the bond guarantees the full value of the estate/trust

				mostly you waive bond in the governing instrument

				this becomes an issue when the trustee runs off with the dough

				this comes out of the trust or estate, fiduc gets paid regardless


		PROPER SELF DEALING

			if its really in eveyrone's best interests

			you can get settlor's consent
			or
			you can get consent of all the beneficiaries
				including minor and unborn beneficiaries
			or
			you can go to court before you do it
				theyll tell you yes or no


		GLEESON'S WILL

			the settlor dies

			the PR was farming one of the pieces of land

				he wasnt a beneficiary under the will

			settlor dies two weeks before the lease was up

			this guy had a week to figure out what to do with the land

			his options:

				-renew the lease for himself
					he renewed at a higher price
					benes got a sweet deal
					different from Hartman
				-renew the lease for someone else
					in a week only
				-let it go without leasing
					but that means no rent

				none is great

			he did the best thing for the beneficiaries

			nonetheless, the court found against him

				he shoulda gotten the consent of the beneficiaries

				or

				gone to court to get instructions

					but is this option realistic?
					should he have known to do this?
					could he have had time to?

				OR

				he could have refused to be the executor

					this would have solved the lease problem
					and he would have likely paid less


			taking on a fiduciary duty is a lot of responsibility

				mostly people dont sue on this stuff

				but bad shit plays out when they do

				think twice about accepting a trustee role

					especially if its not paid


				doing it as a pro is a little different

					get more knowledge

					get a rider on top of your normal malpractice insurance


		structural conflicts

			are an exception to the no-further-inquiry rule

			if you're a shareholder and named as a trustee

				and the settlor knew about the conflict

			then the court presumes the settlor meant for the arrangment

			the court lets the trustee vote the shares without any self dealing

			BAR EXAM likes these fact patterns

			keep an eye out for settlor's structural conflict



		IN RE ROTHKO

			Rothko left all his assets to a charitable foundation

			the daughter has standing nonetheless bc of a NY law that allowed children to set aside part of a charitable devise

				mortmain statutes

					policy:

						some man of the cloth visits you on your deathbed and sways you to change your will to leave it to the church to imporve your chances of getting into heaven

						to mitigate the impact of this undue influence on your heirs, statutes allowed kids to come in and get a half of your total estate

					theyre gone now, but they drove the rothko case

				without these, the kdis would not have standing to challenge an executor's actions

					they could test the will, but no suits on breach of exec duties

			Rothko put three coexecutors in place

				Reis
					treasurer and secretary at the gallery
					he got ten percent while R was alive
					he bumped his commish to 50% on R's death
				Stamos
					shitty artist whose job was to do whatever Reis said
					Reis was also selling Stamos' paintings
				Levine
					a bit out of it

			principal assets of the estate were the paintings

				798 of them

			the coexecs sold 100 to the gallery for 1.8 million

				18k/painting
				this was clealy underselling these
				very clearly self dealing
				very clealy under market price
				done deal inside of three weeks

			this was self dealing and conflict of interest bc

				of the issue whether rothko's existing contract survived his death
				sometimes a contract can survive the death of a party

				reis wanted it not to survive so he could bump his commission

			[any time you see a lichtenstein corp there's something fishy goin on]

			the court found that reis and stamos had engaged in self dealing

			reis was also found guilty of self-dealing

				bc he looked the other way

				if you are a co-trustee and you witness some bad shit you have an obligation to do something about it

					not just voting against it
					you gotta act against it
					as in go to court

					levine shoulda gone to court right away

						he also coulda tried to resign
						but he'd need consent or court approval

						even if he'd voted aginst it and resigned, he'd still be liable

						you can't escape trustee liability for stuff that's already happened just by resigning EXAM

			COURT hits these guys with appreciation damages

				value at time of opinion minus what they were sold for

					and then they're jointly and severally liable for that amt

				levine got tagged for a slightly lower amount

			Maybe this could have gone down as a settlor-created structural conflict

				this would have let these guys off the hook to some extent

				the remedy would have been the difference at the time of the sale between reality and market

				the bulk of the damages were the appreciation damages from the later years, this would have made a significant difference

		it used to be that you'd need a unanimous vote to to anything with multiple trustees

			now you just need a majority



		CHARITABLE PRIVATE FOUNDATION v CHIN/ZUCKERBERG LLC

			Private Foundation:

				there's a lot of limitations on private foundations

				5% must come out every year

					if there's not big growth, you're drying up

				donor can't be the majority on the board

				immediately charitable income tax deduction that carries for five years

			Zuck style LLC:

				different tax consequences

				only get deductions when the money goes out to a charity

				no min or max for output

				thye can be 100% in charge

				only drawback is that they don't get full up front charitable income tax deduction

				they'll dole out the money every year so that they give away just about what they need to offset their income tax in a given year

				this will grow in the near future
