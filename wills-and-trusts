WILLS AND TRUSTS DAY 1

Forced share: certain amount goes to [each kid]

community property state: earnings in a marriage are split 50/50

	12 are cps

	the rest are separate property states

elective share: allows a spouse to claim a portion of the decedent’s estate despite a will to the contrary

	public policy restriction on testator freedom

	Georgia has no elective share and is not a community property state.  you can do anything when you die

	type of forced share

ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE: donor’s intent

	to be read from the document


SHAPIRA v UNION

testate: died with a will

intestate: died without a will

specific devises: give a particular thing to a particular group

general devise: cash gift

residuary clause: sweeps up the rest

gift over clause: to A but if A is not alive, to B

-argued unconst under 14th amdnmnt

personal representative: person who will handle the estate

	if you have a will, you name the person in the will

	if you don’t have a will, there’s a statute

	this displaced the now-outdated “executor/administrator”

-it’s not a violation of the 14th for a state court to deal with church-related restrictions on testator’s behalf

the state atty general is always in charge of prosecuting this kind of thing on behalf of a church or charity

-14th am issue thrown out

-public policy argument

	if its a partial restriction, it’s generally valid

	this one doesn’t stop someone from marrying, only directs it

	marry a jew is fine, marry no one is not acceptable

	limiting to the pool of jewish women is just fine

	limiting to 7 years just fine

clients always want to control the behavior of the recipient

“no remarriage” would be struck

the modern solution to this problem is the trust

B puts money in trust for the benefit of A during A’s lifetime, with the remainder to B’s children

this trust structure has taken over the turf formerly occupied by wills like Shapira’s

tax incentives tend to compel trust structures

if you put any kind of restriction on A’s money, you lose the unlimited marital estate tax deduction

so you can usually convince a person to switch off the restriction by telling them they’ll lose 40 percent to the estate tax



RIGHT TO INHERIT, RIGHT TO CONVEY

you do not have a right to inherit

you do not have a constitutional right to devise (there are some restrictions)

after Hodel and Babbit, you have a constitutional right to devise to your children

native americans don’t have wills quite as often as most americans

the property passes through intestacy statutes

A dies, blackacre passes to the children as tenants in common

this, over time, fractionalized the land

the investors bought a small share, forced a sale, and bought it cheap



top choices for property on death:

1- government confiscation
2- forced shares
3- testator freedom


	we have a combination of all three of these

	federal level has transfer tax (above 5.43 million gets a 40% tax, except to charities and US spouses)

	states mostly have inheritance tax

	forced share common throughout world, but not here



ways to get funds from parents to kids:

	lifetime gifts (limited per person and comes out of your 5.4m limit, annual exclusion is 14k per person per 	year)

		generation skipping transfer (limited to 5.4m too)

		bargain sale to kids similar

	move (funds or domicile, this avoids state inheritance tax)

		you could also move offshore

	salary you kid in the business (stupidly high salary, but limited by IRS)

	give the gift of education (human and cultural capital)

		support is a legal obligation, you can fulfill that magnificently (food shelter clothing education) and it is 		not a taxable gift

		you can make unlimited medical and educational expenses straight to the provider without taxation

	tangible personal property (give gold and diamonds to the kids, no paper trail not even a title)


65% of the IRS budget is spent on enforcement

	as a political matter we don’t want indefinite political and economic oligopolies






WILLS DAY 21


	NY BAR:  TOTTEN TRUSTS, even though they're totally unimportant

		totten trust:  a POD bank account substitute.

			to o as trustee for a.  o retained right to withdraw funds.
			when o dies, a gets whatever remains.
			this is not a real trust, despite the name.
			answer the question as if POD designation.


	VARELA v BERNACHEA

		FACTS:
			two argentinian lovers
			fella was married to someone else
			guy titles his mistress as a joint tenant on the CMA
				CMA: cash mgmt acct.  brokerage account with checking power.
			guy gets sick, kids arrive, boot the mistress out
			she withdraws 280k
			she makes a new account with ML and deposits there
				[she shoulda gone to BoA]
				they would have refused to give the money back

		he wins at trial ct level because he had no donative intent

		Account types:

			Joint Tenancy:
				both parties have rights
				irrevocable.  o cannot unilaterally withdraw
				o cannot unilaterally close
				divorce turns it into TinC
			Agency:
				agent can draw while principle lives
				they can write checks, but get nothing on death
				requires trust, they can write full acct value checks
				revocable during O's competence
			POD:
				payable on death
				revocable, changeable any time

			Teller just gives you the JT form
			Its better for banks because its lower liability
				they don't have to worry about who dies when in a JT

		He understood the JT rules

		Majority rule:  you're presumed to have made a gift of at least 1/2 of the contents of the account when you add a person as a JT

			it's a reubttable presumption in FL (not everywhere)
			but because of the facts, he could not rebut

		UPC: net contribution rule (adopted in many states)

			if he loaded the funds, she can't clean him out
			3/4 and 1/4 split in funding = same rights to access

		IRS:

			JT with non-spouse: net contribution rule
			JT with spouse: 1/2 is presumed gift, 1/2 estate taxed

		"You gotta be careful.  Christina will clean you out." -TT


	Tenancy by the Entirety:

		only for married couples
		only in some states
			in some, it's only for real property
		stronger than JT
		dissolves to JT or TinC on divorce
		you cannot force the sale of a property
			contrasts to JT, where either party can force the sale
			A can unilaterally force it from JT to TinC
			then A can force the sale


	PLANNING FOR INCAPACITY

		"most important 40 minutes we will have this semester"

		AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS in incapacity:

			HORRIBLE: GUARDIANSHIP
			BAD: CONSERVATORSHIP
			GOOD: UTMA/UGMA
			GREAT: REVOCABLE TRUST

				build a mechanism into a trust that determines incapacitation
				majority vote of nuclear family and doctor

		POWERS OF ATTORNEY:

			Ordinary Power of Attorney:

				the person is your agent until you become incapacitated
				theyre essentiall useless

			Durable Power of Attorney:

				statutory override of common law
				valid right away and carries thorugh incapacity

			Sprining Power of Attorney:

				not valid immediately
				only becomes valid on incompetence
					or you can specify any trigger you want

				theyre out of style
					institutions are suspicious of them
					bank must investiage the incapacity
					too much headache
						banks sent it to lawyers, huge delays
						court would have to give a judgment
						without being sued to comply, bank would not comply
					defeats the purpose of the thing

		Always have separate documents for healthcare and financial PoA

		FPoA can do every financial thing the principle can, except:

			-affidavit
			-will
			-marriage
			-divorce

WILLS DAY 22

	ELECTIVE SHARE
	UPC PROVISIONS
	COMMUNITY PROPERTY

	Community Property:

		once you get married, all the money that comes in via earnings and all the property it buys is community property

		it's immediately owned automatically 1/2 and 1/2

		gifts and inheritance kept separate are separate property

			if theyre intermingled, they become community property

			what you bring to the marriage is separate too until mingled

		EXAM:  THERES NO ELECTIVE SHARE IN A COMMUNITY PROPERTY JDX

		A can devise all separate property and half the community property


	ELECTIVE SHARE

		started in NY

			elective share law has developed in an arms race with practitioners who find ways to avoid it

		NY now has a very tough separate property elective share

		AUGMENTED ESTATE:

			the pie you take the elective share out of

		it's often 1/2 if no prior marriage
		it's often 1/3 if prior marriage or kids

		most states now incorporate non probate property too

		ALSO APPLIES TO INTESTACY

			most people speak of electing against the will

			however, you can also elect over intestacy

			atty does the calculations for the client and you take whichever is higher

			EXAM: apply elective share to intestacy problems

			policy question: GA revocable trust, which law should govern?

			DELAWARE:  the augmented share is whatever the IRS says is in your gross estate

				this makes it tough to dodge the elective share, because IRS thinks of everything


		UPC ELECTIVE SHARE STATUTE

			tries to match itself to the partnership theory of marriage

			they should share regardless of who earns

			75k no matter what

			then grows the longer you're married

			EXAM ANALYSIS PROCEDURE:

			UPC augmented estate:

				-A's and B's property
				-apply the percentage from p535
				-B gets 75k plus 1/2 of step 2
				-subtract out what B has been given


	PRENUP REQUIREMENTS:

		-written and preferably notarized
		-complete and accurate financial disclosure
		-each party represented by competent and independent counsel
		-free of coercive behavior
			(can't be right before the marriage.  6 months before)
		-reasonable
			at time executed
			at time of divorce or death


	REECE v ELLIOT

		financial disclosure is the issue

		he didn't give up info about some closely held stock he owned

			IBM requires no disclosure of value (bc NYSE)
			a private company (bc not publicly available)

		court said it didnt matter bc party was not getting the assets anyhow

		executed 5 days before marriage (too close)

		high risk bc no declaration of value



	As bad as this all sounds, client's won't be super into it

	ALTERNATIVES:

		an irrevocable trust set up by A's parents for the benfit of A before marriage (3rd party)

		SD/NV self settled asset protection trust (domestic asset protection trust)

		GO OFFSHORE!  Cook Islands Asset Protection Trust



WILLS PENULTIMATE CLASS

	last exam is on Bb under content

	Community property:

		if you come to the marriage or inherit, it's separate

		if you earn it while married or buy it with that money, then it's community property

		on death, A can devise all his separate property and half the community property

		B is entitled to nothing because she already owns 1/2

		PLANNING:

			move from one kind of jdx to another

			community to separate:

				as long as they don't convert the community property, it retains its character despite a move to NY

				any earnings following the move follow separate property rules

				the elective share won't apply to the community property

				it will apply to all the stuff after the move

				xr p550

					the law of the situs governs real estate

				you can convert by contract the community property into separate property

					marriage contract, joint checking account

				or you can leave it in its community property form

					for tax advantages

					you can set up an AK trust and have it deemed community property even if you live in a separate property state

				punchline:  make sure your clients understand the consequences
				make sure they preserve the community nature of the property

			moving from separate to community:

				A is a big earner and holds the dough in his sole name

				they move to CA to retire

				no more earning, A dies

				A leaves a will leaving everything to kids from a prior marriage

				B gets NOTHING, no elective share option, nada

					some states have quasi-community property to remedy this

			quasi-community property:

				separate property is treated as if its community property

				as long as it would have been treated as community property if it had been earned in the new jdx


			community property held solely in A's name cannot be sold unilaterally by A

				this protects the Bs of the world


	Miscellaneous Marriage Rights:

		IRAs are not subject to ERISA

			you can roll some plans under some circumstances into an IRA to avoid erisa

		CURTESY AND DOWER

			only relevance is for real prperty, only applies to RP

			a separate property jdx that still has dower requires both signatures to sell a property even if it's in A's sole name

			it protects the Bs of the world


	Omission

		Intentional omission:

			you can disinhereit a kid

			they get no elective share except in Louisiana

			but even LA has a set of exceptions

				-child has hit parent
				-child has been cruel
				-failed to communicate for two years
				-etc


		Unintentional omission of a spouse:

			the omitted spouse doctrine assumes that you forgot to update your will if you got married and didnt change it

				you can beat it by making wills both before and after that mention the marriage

			PRESTIE

				guy has a revocable trust and a pourover will

				son was beneficiary

				no provision made for on-again-off-again wife

				he updates the trust to give w a LE in the condo

				he dies

				she wants more than just the LE

				she sues to get more under the omitted spouse doctrine

				she wants the will revoked to the extent she was "shorted" so she can get her intestate share

				the court knows he DID account for her

				but because the statute is inflexible and only says "will"

				they let her get an intestate share on top of her LE


		Pretermitted Children

			Will, then kid, then death

			the law assumes you would certainly have left something to your kids

			GRAY v GRAY

				john makes a will leaving everything to mary

				they divorce, will is auto-revoked

				jack sues for his intestate share

				EXAM FACT PATTERN

				know antilapse and especially NO RESIDUE OF RESIDUE RULE

				T had kids when the will was executed and left all his estate to the omitted child's [jack's] mom

					this is an anomolous application of the AL statute

WILLS FINAL CLASS

	Fiduciary duties
		especially trustee's duties

		old way: you only had those powers that were enumerated in the doc

		classic tension:  giving the trustee broad powers v safguarding the beneficiaries

		modern solution: default broad powers subject to fiduciary duties

			they have extremely broad powers as a modern trustee unless the doc restricts you otherwise

			the restrictions come from fiduciary law now

		if you breach one of your fiduciary duties, mad litigation

		S815 UPC gives you the powers at once
		S816 UPC enumerates the powers to facilitate transactions

			most pracitioners still list everything

			it's easier to get a bank to open a trust account if you have a one liner in your doc that enumerates the power of [opening a checking account]

		THIRD PARTIES:

			used to be they had a duty to inquire as to the legality of the action the trustee was trying to do

				RE broker had a duty to look into the trust

				this slowed down the process and reqd court intervention

			now, no duty to inquire

				this allows third parties to be more comfy in dealing with fiduciaries without having to run it past general counsel

		POWERS v DUTIES

			some trustee might have the power to do a thing, but that's separate from the duty inquiry

			you can have the power to do a thing

			and still violate your duty if you did it badly

			two step inquiry:

				-does truste have the power to do it?
					this is almost always yes now
				-did they breach a duty when they used that power?
					this is where the litigation is at now

		CHARITABLE TRUSTS

			private trusts can be set up for human beneficiaries
			or
			for a charitable purpose

			if you have a charitable trust, the person in charge of enforcing the fiduc duty is the atty general of the state

			sometimes the settlor, if still living, can allege a breach of fiduc duty

			ATTY GENERAL must get involved to remedy a breach of fiduc duty for a charitable trust

			at any given time, there's tens of thousands that need attention

			they'd do noting else if they really had to handle it all

			POLICY ISSUE? EXAM?


		HARTMAN v HARTLE

			decedent leaves a will naming the son in laws as executors
				this is rare and harsh, probably pissed kids off

			will says to sell all RE and distribute proceeds

			they sold some

			at issue is the farm

			this piece got sold in a sham transaction to give it to one of the executors to sell

			law would collapse that sham transaction

			NO SELF DEALING RULE

				you cant make a sweet deal to advance your own interests as a fiduc

				you can't make any self deal as a fiduciary

					self dealing = ITS OVER

					no further inquiry rule

				if you engage in self dealing, you've violated your duty

			REMEDIES

				hold trustee liable for the profit made (this case)
				compel trustee to return the property (if purchase from trust)
				repay purchase price and take back property (if sale from trust)

			the property here had been sold to a BFP

				therefore BFP gets to keep property and trustee has to pay up


			BONDING

				if youre a PR or a trustee, state law often requires you to get a fidcuiary bond from an insurance company (EXPENSIVE 25%)

				the bond guarantees the full value of the estate/trust

				mostly you waive bond in the governing instrument

				this becomes an issue when the trustee runs off with the dough

				this comes out of the trust or estate, fiduc gets paid regardless


		PROPER SELF DEALING

			if its really in eveyrone's best interests

			you can get settlor's consent

			or

			you can get consent of all the beneficiaries
				including minor and unborn beneficiaries

			or

			you can go to court before you do it
				theyll tell you yes or no


		GLEESON'S WILL

			the settlor dies

			the PR was farming one of the pieces of land

				he wasnt a beneficiary under the will

			settlor dies two weeks before the lease was up

			this guy had a week to figure out what to do with the land

			his options:

				-renew the lease for himself
					he renewed at a higher price
					benes got a sweet deal
					different from Hartman
				-renew the lease for someone else
					in a week only
				-let it go without leasing
					but that means no rent

				none is great

			he did the best thing for the beneficiaries

			nonetheless, the court found against him

				he shoulda gotten the consent of the beneficiaries

				or

				gone to court to get instructions

					but is this option realistic?
					should he have known to do this?
					could he have had time to?

				OR

				he could have refused to be the executor

					this would have solved the lease problem
					and he would have likely paid less


			taking on a fiduciary duty is a lot of responsibility

				mostly people dont sue on this stuff

				but bad shit plays out when they do

				think twice about accepting a trustee role

					especially if its not paid


				doing it as a pro is a little different

					get more knowledge

					get a rider on top of your normal malpractice insurance


		structural conflicts

			are an exception to the no-further-inquiry rule

			if you're a shareholder and named as a trustee

				and the settlor knew about the conflict

			then the court presumes the settlor meant for the arrangment

			the court lets the trustee vote the shares without any self dealing

			BAR EXAM likes these fact patterns

			keep an eye out for settlor's structural conflict



		IN RE ROTHKO

			Rothko left all his assets to a charitable foundation

			the daughter has standing nonetheless bc of a NY law that allowed children to set aside part of a charitable devise

				mortmain statutes

					policy:

						some man of the cloth visits you on your deathbed and sways you to change your will to leave it to the church to imporve your chances of getting into heaven

						to mitigate the impact of this undue influence on your heirs, statutes allowed kids to come in and get a half of your total estate

					theyre gone now, but they drove the rothko case

				without these, the kdis would not have standing to challenge an executor's actions

					they could test the will, but no suits on breach of exec duties

			Rothko put three coexecutors in place

				Reis
					treasurer and secretary at the gallery
					he got ten percent while R was alive
					he bumped his commish to 50% on R's death
				Stamos
					shitty artist whose job was to do whatever Reis said
					Reis was also selling Stamos' paintings
				Levine
					a bit out of it

			principal assets of the estate were the paintings

				798 of them

			the coexecs sold 100 to the gallery for 1.8 million

				18k/painting
				this was clealy underselling these
				very clearly self dealing
				very clealy under market price
				done deal inside of three weeks

			this was self dealing and conflict of interest bc

				of the issue whether rothko's existing contract survived his death
				sometimes a contract can survive the death of a party

				reis wanted it not to survive so he could bump his commission

			[any time you see a lichtenstein corp there's something fishy goin on]

			the court found that reis and stamos had engaged in self dealing

			reis was also found guilty of self-dealing

				bc he looked the other way

				if you are a co-trustee and you witness some bad shit you have an obligation to do something about it

					not just voting against it
					you gotta act against it
					as in go to court

					levine shoulda gone to court right away

						he also coulda tried to resign
						but he'd need consent or court approval

						even if he'd voted aginst it and resigned, he'd still be liable

						you can't escape trustee liability for stuff that's already happened just by resigning EXAM

			COURT hits these guys with appreciation damages

				value at time of opinion minus what they were sold for

					and then they're jointly and severally liable for that amt

				levine got tagged for a slightly lower amount

			Maybe this could have gone down as a settlor-created structural conflict

				this would have let these guys off the hook to some extent

				the remedy would have been the difference at the time of the sale between reality and market

				the bulk of the damages were the appreciation damages from the later years, this would have made a significant difference

		it used to be that you'd need a unanimous vote to to anything with multiple trustees

			now you just need a majority



		CHARITABLE PRIVATE FOUNDATION v CHIN/ZUCKERBERG LLC

			Private Foundation:

				there's a lot of limitations on private foundations

				5% must come out every year

					if there's not big growth, you're drying up

				donor can't be the majority on the board

				immediately charitable income tax deduction that carries for five years

			Zuck style LLC:

				different tax consequences

				only get deductions when the money goes out to a charity

				no min or max for output

				thye can be 100% in charge

				only drawback is that they don't get full up front charitable income tax deduction

				they'll dole out the money every year so that they give away just about what they need to offset their income tax in a given year

				this will grow in the near future
