WILLS AND TRUSTS DAY 1

Forced share: certain amount goes to [each kid]

community property state: earnings in a marriage are split 50/50

	12 are cps

	the rest are separate property states

elective share: allows a spouse to claim a portion of the decedent’s estate despite a will to the contrary

	public policy restriction on testator freedom

	Georgia has no elective share and is not a community property state.  you can do anything when you die

	type of forced share

ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE: donor’s intent

	to be read from the document


SHAPIRA v UNION

testate: died with a will

intestate: died without a will

specific devises: give a particular thing to a particular group

general devise: cash gift

residuary clause: sweeps up the rest

gift over clause: to A but if A is not alive, to B

-argued unconst under 14th amdnmnt

personal representative: person who will handle the estate

	if you have a will, you name the person in the will

	if you don’t have a will, there’s a statute

	this displaced the now-outdated “executor/administrator”

-it’s not a violation of the 14th for a state court to deal with church-related restrictions on testator’s behalf

the state atty general is always in charge of prosecuting this kind of thing on behalf of a church or charity

-14th am issue thrown out

-public policy argument

	if its a partial restriction, it’s generally valid

	this one doesn’t stop someone from marrying, only directs it

	marry a jew is fine, marry no one is not acceptable

	limiting to the pool of jewish women is just fine

	limiting to 7 years just fine

clients always want to control the behavior of the recipient

“no remarriage” would be struck

the modern solution to this problem is the trust

B puts money in trust for the benefit of A during A’s lifetime, with the remainder to B’s children

this trust structure has taken over the turf formerly occupied by wills like Shapira’s

tax incentives tend to compel trust structures

if you put any kind of restriction on A’s money, you lose the unlimited marital estate tax deduction

so you can usually convince a person to switch off the restriction by telling them they’ll lose 40 percent to the estate tax



RIGHT TO INHERIT, RIGHT TO CONVEY

you do not have a right to inherit

you do not have a constitutional right to devise (there are some restrictions)

after Hodel and Babbit, you have a constitutional right to devise to your children

native americans don’t have wills quite as often as most americans

the property passes through intestacy statutes

A dies, blackacre passes to the children as tenants in common

this, over time, fractionalized the land

the investors bought a small share, forced a sale, and bought it cheap



top choices for property on death:

1- government confiscation
2- forced shares
3- testator freedom


	we have a combination of all three of these

	federal level has transfer tax (above 5.43 million gets a 40% tax, except to charities and US spouses)

	states mostly have inheritance tax

	forced share common throughout world, but not here



ways to get funds from parents to kids:

	lifetime gifts (limited per person and comes out of your 5.4m limit, annual exclusion is 14k per person per 	year)

		generation skipping transfer (limited to 5.4m too)

		bargain sale to kids similar

	move (funds or domicile, this avoids state inheritance tax)

		you could also move offshore

	salary you kid in the business (stupidly high salary, but limited by IRS)

	give the gift of education (human and cultural capital)

		support is a legal obligation, you can fulfill that magnificently (food shelter clothing education) and it is 		not a taxable gift

		you can make unlimited medical and educational expenses straight to the provider without taxation

	tangible personal property (give gold and diamonds to the kids, no paper trail not even a title)


65% of the IRS budget is spent on enforcement

	as a political matter we don’t want indefinite political and economic oligopolies






WILLS DAY 21


	NY BAR:  TOTTEN TRUSTS, even though they're totally unimportant

		totten trust:  a POD bank account substitute.

			to o as trustee for a.  o retained right to withdraw funds.
			when o dies, a gets whatever remains.
			this is not a real trust, despite the name.
			answer the question as if POD designation.


	VARELA v BERNACHEA

		FACTS:
			two argentinian lovers
			fella was married to someone else
			guy titles his mistress as a joint tenant on the CMA
				CMA: cash mgmt acct.  brokerage account with checking power.
			guy gets sick, kids arrive, boot the mistress out
			she withdraws 280k
			she makes a new account with ML and deposits there
				[she shoulda gone to BoA]
				they would have refused to give the money back

		he wins at trial ct level because he had no donative intent

		Account types:

			Joint Tenancy:
				both parties have rights
				irrevocable.  o cannot unilaterally withdraw
				o cannot unilaterally close
				divorce turns it into TinC
			Agency:
				agent can draw while principle lives
				they can write checks, but get nothing on death
				requires trust, they can write full acct value checks
				revocable during O's competence
			POD:
				payable on death
				revocable, changeable any time

			Teller just gives you the JT form
			Its better for banks because its lower liability
				they don't have to worry about who dies when in a JT

		He understood the JT rules

		Majority rule:  you're presumed to have made a gift of at least 1/2 of the contents of the account when you add a person as a JT

			it's a reubttable presumption in FL (not everywhere)
			but because of the facts, he could not rebut

		UPC: net contribution rule (adopted in many states)

			if he loaded the funds, she can't clean him out
			3/4 and 1/4 split in funding = same rights to access

		IRS:

			JT with non-spouse: net contribution rule
			JT with spouse: 1/2 is presumed gift, 1/2 estate taxed

		"You gotta be careful.  Christina will clean you out." -TT


	Tenancy by the Entirety:

		only for married couples
		only in some states
			in some, it's only for real property
		stronger than JT
		dissolves to JT or TinC on divorce
		you cannot force the sale of a property
			contrasts to JT, where either party can force the sale
			A can unilaterally force it from JT to TinC
			then A can force the sale


	PLANNING FOR INCAPACITY

		"most important 40 minutes we will have this semester"

		AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS in incapacity:

			HORRIBLE: GUARDIANSHIP
			BAD: CONSERVATORSHIP
			GOOD: UTMA/UGMA
			GREAT: REVOCABLE TRUST

				build a mechanism into a trust that determines incapacitation
				majority vote of nuclear family and doctor

		POWERS OF ATTORNEY:

			Ordinary Power of Attorney:

				the person is your agent until you become incapacitated
				theyre essentiall useless

			Durable Power of Attorney:

				statutory override of common law
				valid right away and carries thorugh incapacity

			Sprining Power of Attorney:

				not valid immediately
				only becomes valid on incompetence
					or you can specify any trigger you want

				theyre out of style
					institutions are suspicious of them
					bank must investiage the incapacity
					too much headache
						banks sent it to lawyers, huge delays
						court would have to give a judgment
						without being sued to comply, bank would not comply
					defeats the purpose of the thing

		Always have separate documents for healthcare and financial PoA

		FPoA can do every financial thing the principle can, except:

			-affidavit
			-will
			-marriage
			-divorce
