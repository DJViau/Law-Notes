RET DAY 2

Clients don’t pay for critical thinking, they pay for strategic action.

MARSH v WALLACE

Marsh wants the properties because he really wants the cash flow

his willingness to restructure the deal is evidence of his desire for the cash

the representations of the history of the cash flow is a sticking point for this reason


attempt one: I’ll buy the thing with my own financing

BUT: can’t get financing

attempt two: I’ll take the thing, along with your debts, and the rest can be financed by the seller

BUT: can’t get around the due-on-sale clauses, bank won’t allow it

attempt three: We’ll buy the LLCs (see slide show)

BUT: is this even a RET?


use and enjoyment
exclusion of others
transfer to whoever
profits (mainly in the form of appreciation)


You have rights to these things under property law unless the lender says you can’t do these things


in the third transaction, they’re buying assets.  no deed. maybe no mortgage.  it’s a RET, but its a non-property transaction.  This is like a merger and acquisition.  the land is still owned by the same entity, but the entity is now controlled by another.  it’s an end run around the lender.

the savvy lender should write an extra paragraph that locks the individual in and the entity.


the three different modes require three different sets of documents


the bummed out buyer wants to sue the seller, because they think they got fraudulent misrepresentations from the seller.

the court says no.

buyer can’t recover from the seller.  the buyer now says the lawyer fucked up.

buyer succeeds in this and lawyer howell is on the hook for 20k in legal fees.


how much info is full info?


howell used to work for the seller.  seller is gonna get some dough from the sale.  the dough is gonna pay howell.

howell has an incentive to push the deal through, even if it sucks for the buyer (who he’s supposed to represent)

he has a conflict of interest

howell has perhaps not clarified who he represents.  maybe he doesn’t even know.



WRITE THE AGREEMENT: what services, how payment, any disclosures

get the things signed and put it in the file

the client usually doesn’t care about these kinds of things, they’ll sign off

write a nice little letter, just to clarify that I’m at the closing to represent the bank, and I do not represent you, you should get your own attorney to represent your own interest

courts will often allow the suit if the party has any reasonable basis for thinking you represent them

as part of documenting the deal, build this little barrier


DUTY OF LOYALTY
DUTY OF CONFIDENCE
DUTY OF DISCLOSURE


END CHAPTER ONE

CH 2 Broker’s responsibilities

WOLK v PAINO

the suit is not about failure to disclose a defect (mold)

it’s about failure to insist on an inspection


Wolk read and signed, waiving the inspection


sometimes the rules of disclosure change if you ask a direct question

AS A LAWYER, create a list of direct questions to ask the broker about (crime, HIV, etc…)



HOLMES v SUMMER

HILLIS v LAKE

the broker gets the commission when the procure a ready, willing, and able buyer

no closing is necessary

this is a MA case, and they have a minority rule:

no closing, no commish

exception:

if the seller causes the transaction not to close, the buyer gets commish anyhow

seller must be at fault

he is at fault if the buyer could sue for breach of contract



the deal doesn’t close here because there’s environmental contamination

so they try to put together another deal

lake is one of the buyers, puts up a third

lake is also the lender on the second deal, tenants will make monthly payments to him


RULE: if the second deal is essentially the same as the first deal, broker is entitled to the commish

are these two deal substantially the same?

broker argues yes, but the risk allocation is much different

the risk disparity is enough for the court to say they’re two different deals altogether and therefore no commission



RET DAY 4

precontract:

negotiation (at what point does this turn into contract?)
broker’s listing agreement
letter of intent / option contract
parol evidence rule (prior and simultaneous info excluded. signed document alone survives)


contract:

statute of frauds
	writing requirement
	essential terms
	signed by person to be enforced against
	writing is a memorial, but everything before it is excluded

doctrine of equitable conversion
	splits the title
	rule of equity (affects remedies and what needs to be proved)
	seller keeps legal title, buyer gets equitable title
	risk lands largely on buyer
	both parties can do a lot of stuff
		sell, assign, lease, pelage, mortgage, devise, and insure
		so long as the title is in the state promised by the time of closing
	if the seller doesn’t want the buyer to transfer, then they have to contract for it
	the legal title is an equitable interest (right to get the money at closing promised by buyer)
	the equitable title is a legal right to get the title
	both interests are insurable
	creditors can reach the interests of both parties

		you can write the provision however you want.  contract around the defaults.

		if you wanna fuck up someone’s title, record the purchase contract in public records and then fuck off

	integration clause
	insurance for loss
	deposits and commissions


Are contracting entities properly formed?
	you need to have a real grantor and a real grantee
	when dealing with a corporation
		you want to see not only evidence of their ownership, but evidence of the existence
		minutes, certificate of good st, articles of incorporation, corporate seals on the docs authorizing sale, etc
	write it into the contract that the corporation must show off their docs


There are different categories of property involved in the sale


Warranty deeds can’t transfer personal property

governed by article 2 instead

most real estate lawyers skip this



Moran v Erk

atty contingency


the law often implies a duty to act in good faith into a contract provision

but here, any reason or no reason is good to cancel the deal

so it’s really more like a free option, not a contingency or condition

its practical effect is a free option (3 day), but it is not in any official sense


the absence of a good faith limitation is about the attorney client privilege

so don’t analogize this case to other areas of contract law




Holscher v James

fire prior to closing

p86

contract had a provision

voidable at option of buyer if destroyed before closing



once it’s signed, both parties have an insurable interest

insurance is a personal contract (privity required)


traditionally, if the seller had it insured and it burned, they’d collect the insurance proceeds and still force the buyer to buy it

most states have now adopted the opposite rule, where the burden is equitably split to prevent a windfall to the seller (seller gets proceeds, gives credit to buyer)

1. who had the risk?
	this is the person who gets the burden
2. who had the insurance?
	this is the person who gets the dough

fuck the equities, fuck piles of dough, look to the law and the insurance contract



Louisiana real estate v butler

“It’s a cash deal”

	is the default rule

		if you need financing, buyer can draft a clause

		but

		it’s only what you write

		if you only write that you need 8 1/2% financing, that’s it

		you get 100 bucks financed at that rate, you met the condition, and you have to close

		if you need 90k at that rate, then write it in

		this only gets you a condition for the rate, not the amount, ARM or fixed, etc



WRITE THIS SHIT IN

but its going to be interpreted narrowly

so be sure to write in EVERYTHING you need


ALH holding company v. bank of telluride

ALH is seller

gives credit

makes the buyer go get more credit

traditional rule:

	“first in time is first in right”

modern addition:

	“recording time is legal time”

here bank recorded first

but

the seller gets priority as lender.



two mortgages, bank is first in time

normally under the traditional rule, bank would win

here, this is a race-notice jdx

so

the court says that despite the bank recording first, they had notice

they knew about the PMM

so they were on notice before they recorded

because they had notice of ALH’s interest, and were supposed to know colorado law, they weren’t first in time

the fact they had notice means they knew that ALH had priority



THE ONLY THINGS YOU HAVE RIGHTS TO AT CLOSING ARE THE THINGS YOU EXPRESSED IN THE CONTRACT


EVERYTHING WILL BE CONSTRUED NARROWLY


BE THOROUGH, BE PRECISE


RET DAY 5

finishing up chapter 4

execution of contract ——>  executory period ——> closing


what’s in the contract governs the executory period (“I promise to generate a report and deliver clear title”)

	the title must be clear by closing

	closing is the opportunity to “inspect the goods”

		the goods are the physical property and the associated documents



rights:

	use and possession
	right to exclude
	right to transfer (and mortgage etc)
	right to the profits


affordable housing (no interests, subsidized) but the gov’t gets 100% or 50% of the appreciation value

the condition is imposed to help balance the equation



you don’t have a right to see the articles of incorporation, etc unless you write it into the contract




a warranty deed only transfers the part of the deal that’s real property

	you’d also want a bill of sale for the appliances

a warranty deed conveys the building and the land of a factory

	you’d also want a document conveying the conveyor belts/ inventory/ accounts receivable etc

	if the buyer’s atty didn’t contract for it, seller can refuse it

	you can say no i don’t want to give it because I don’t want the risk of the associated warranties

	if you didn’t want the risk, buyer, you should have contracted for it back in the negotiation



GIVE YOURSELF A RIGHT TO SEE THE IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS (articles of inc.) IN THE CONTRACT

GIVE YOURSELF A RIGHT TO GET THE DOCUMENTS FOR ALL THE INTERESTS (personalty, etc)


contracts:

	parties
	property
	price

the law will write in everything else

as drafter, write in everything you need

for financing, write in the specifics

	or else you will be forced forward if someone can meet your requirements


Buyer’s atty’s job is to get all that which was bargained for

Seller’s atty’s job is to make sure you give nothing greater than what was agreed to

if you give more, the transaction should have been priced differently



DOCUMENT THE DEAL

MANAGE THE RISK

MANAGE THE TIME


order of performance
clock time
legal time


ALH v bank of telluride

issue is legal time

the institutional bank thought they’d get first dibs because they recorded first

but

they had notice of the other guy

when you know you’re gonna have multiple creditors, write it into the contract who will get priority

this gets you out of the recording time problems




CHAPTER FIVE

RISK MGMT:

I Identify
R Reduce
S Shift

notice risk, mitigate it, and what can’t be eliminated, shift it (by changing the price of the deal etc)

To identify risk:

invest in information
	survey
	environmental audit

convince the client that these are worth investing in

To reduce the risk:

invest in information
	clear up areas of potential problems

To shift the risk:

contract
	“seller takes risk because he continues use and possession”
	shift it to a third party (buyer can insure his interest with a specialist)


GIVEN THE RISK ARRAY at the end of all that, pick a price

here’s what I have to make in order to justify these risks

no malpractice if you have identified and managed all the risk

don’t let your client sucker you into making a financial assessment


If I know I’m second, no problem I can price that shit right

If I think I’m first and I’m gonna be second because of sloppy lawyering, then malpractice


Advise against excess disclosure.  Let the client give up more to be nice if he wants.


seller has no duty to disclose anything that’s immediately apparent

if the seller knows about things that are latent including termites, radon and ghosts, he has a duty to disclose


	TEST FOR RADON IN THE SUMMER, the snow is a blanket and ratings are higher in the winter

meth lab case = latent
rape house = latent

even though you could read the papers and the police reports


the history of the property shown by photograph collections can sometimes show a potential problem

if the site was a junkyard, the car chemicals might have leeched into the ground

	this would give you a tip to get an env inspection


in some minority of states you only have to disclose latent defects which present a peril

	risk to life and limb

	maybe you don’t have to disclose water damage, unless it impacts structural stability

	this is the traditional rule, based on the default traditional principle of caveat emptor


still, if it would have been caught by a quick and easy inspection, then courts won’t be so friendly


if you have termite damage, and you want more control

	hire and pay the expert, and they will give you the answer you want



DEFINE

“material damage or defect”

material means anything more than 500 bucks to fix

what is reasonable satisfaction?

how long does seller get to remedy the problem?

	you don’t want to pay the mortgage while the seller lounges around fixing the problem

define when the notice is effective (when mailed, when received)





how about disclosure of information about accessory structures?





Perfect v McAndrew


sale per acre, sale in gross?

what if sellers represent sq footage as 2500 and its really 2100?

the banks appraisal is based on square footage

was the house sold by the sq ft or in gross?

think of the third party dynamics (bank, insurance, etc)


DRAFT THE CONTRACT TO LET YOU OUT if the distinction affects your ability to get financing


the in gross sale buys the whole plot


it may be very important which acres you’re short

you want to make sure you get all the acreage

but you also want to make sure that you contract for the part you buy to include the parts you want

any shortfall here, deduct x from the price
any shortfall in the wasteland, deduct y from the price


a difference of more than 30%-35% does not affect anything if the property is being bought in gross

the survey gives a legal description, but you also want the guy to tell you how many acres

define the materiality of a certain number of acres if you care if the acreage turns out different



ENGAGE other professionals to certify this shit so that if something goes wrong, you can sue the bastard for his failure


RET DAY 6

Roles of a RE Lawyer:

	Manage the documents
	Manage the time
	manage the risk

		Identify
		Reduce
		Shift


variations of up to 30% are accepted in an in gross sale

there’s a tendency to fall back on mutual mistake

	but

	it’s really just a way to change the risk rule under equitable conversion that the risk is on the buyer

	it’s a tool to use, but it may not get much traction because it’s an alternative rule to DEC




Clair v Hillenmeyer

there’s patent defect in the septic system

	the buyer is supposed to spot it on his own

	seller needn’t point it out

but here, everyone already knows about it

the existence of the problem is not really whats at issue

the handwritten note wanted the system brought up to code

	what code?

	what’s the point of being there?

	what of the preprinted form that says it must be up to buyer’s satisfaction?

			does it take precedence? replace the form terms?

				if they’re contradictory, it knocks out the form term

				if not, they’re possibly supplemental

	if you’re gonna scribble in some notes, write a sentence defining the relationship between written and typed

	the old guys will make you justify each addition you want

		you’re gonna need to explain why you want to wedge in a new clause

		all of the sudden you’re asking for several new sentences

	if I drafted it, resist.  make the guy explain himself

	be ready to bring up fact patterns that show you know why you need to add terms

the client will want to make you make the decision, but you want to stick to only giving advice




Petrillo v Bachenberg

liability of the lawyer

the lawyer owes a duty to the non-client who the attorney known would rely on the attorney in his or her professional capacity

no more privity limitation

	in a lot of areas of RE law, privity is not the winning argument

	it turns into a negligence/tort action

the attorney should have know the other guys would rely

this goes for pretty much anything the lawyer passes along


mind how you compile and transmit the documents


moving away from privity:

	damages are no longer limited to contract remedies like expectations

	tort damages include punitive damages, plus pain and suffering

it expands the scope of potential suers and expands the remedy available to each


create documents that undercut anyone else’s reasonable expectations of reliance on those

make the other party sign off that they have not relied on you

the law creates certain rules of liability.  you want to manage those yourself instead.



BLOOR v FRITZ

just another disclosure case

whats the realtor’s obligation to disclose?

but it also points out a risk we don’t normally think about

how do you know when a house has been used as a meth lab?


these people had to fix up the house and leave behind all their personal property

this is a potentially huge sum of money


also, the lender doesn’t give a fuck

you promised to pay a certain amount per month


does a bloody murder count as material?

	if it isn’t rational, so what

	if it affects the value, it’s a material fact

		that which affects the value of the transaction is material


if a sex offender moves to your neighborhood, it materially impacts the price of your property (5%)


	four exceptions to the doctrine of merger

		but only if you make all the elements

		otherwise, default rule: everything is merged out


Van Camp v Bradford

	shield laws: some states have laws protecting people from nondisclosure of certain facts (HIV)

	but mostly, they don’t shield you if you’re directly asked

who is liable and who is not?

who had the duty to disclose?

	the seller, not the REA

		the lawyer would probably have an obligation to pull the seller to the side and say ‘disclose’

	if you got asked directly, dodge it

		say that you are not the owner



Lofts at Fillmore v reliance commercial construction

real property now comes with a limited warranty

cases from the 70s overcame centuries of common law

	house construction became much more like mass car production

	so they borrow the implied conditions of usability/livability

		then, the warranty extended beyond the first owner to later buyers for a reasonable amount of time

this case adds the builder to the list of people the buyer can sell, not just the vendor/developer

it extends the reach of the buyer’s opportunity to sue, this case

the court plays a part in the arms race between developers and customers



IN THE US, THERE IS NO PROOF OF OWNERSHIP

	only evidence of ownership

		so you end up talking about relative value of evidence



St louis v Wilkinson


if the lawyer is not the lawyer of the buyer, but merely represents the bank, does the buyer have a reasonable basis to rely on the lawyer?

sophisticated buyer


RET DAY 7




THE EXECUTORY CONTACT DIES AT CLOSING

ONLY THE 6 COMMON LAW COVENANTS

A warranty deed includes six traditional forms of Covenants for Title.[2] Those six traditional forms of covenants can be broken down into two categories: present covenants and future covenants.
	•	Present Covenants
	•	Covenant of Seisin: "A covenant of seisin or good right to convey." [3][2]
	•	Covenant of Right to Convey: Covenants that represent the seller's promise that he has valid title of the property being conveyed. [2]
	•	Covenant Against Encumbrances: Seller promises that there are no encumbrances, other than those that have been previously disclosed. [2]
	•	Future Covenants
	•	Covenant of Warranty: "The covenant of warranty is an assurance or guarantee of title, or an agreement or assurance by the grantor of an estate that the grantee and his or her heirs and assigns will enjoy it without interruption by virtue of a paramount title and that they will not, by force of a paramount title, be evicted from the land or deprived of its possession. . . ." [4][2]
	•	Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment: Covenants that represent seller's promise to protect the buyer against anyone who comes along later and claims paramount title to the property.[5][2]
	•	Covenant of Further Assurances: The covenant of further assurances requires the seller to take affirmative steps to cure any defects in the grantor's title.[6][2]


you only have the rights set out in the deed that you leave with after closing



be able to tell from the language of the documents what names they should get.  don’t trust titles/headings


if they show up with the wrong shit, object at closing

then they’re in breach

but

if you take that shit and accept it as suitable

then

you’re stuck with whatever you got





if you want a clause to survive the closing, write in the executory contract (only about collateral matters) that you intend the warranty to survive the closing AND THE DOCTRINE OF MERGER


(a special warranty deed instead of a general warranty deed is NOT COLLATERAL.  would not work.  if it gets recorded, the public relies on it.  if public relies on it, then it needs to be left alone by the courts)


you can’t contract out of doctrine of merger, or doctrine of equitable conversion



collateral rights exception:

	if its important, write that the warranty survives the transfer

	“seller represents that the pool and its filters are good.  this warranty survives…”


fraud:

mutual mistake:

	vacant lot, sign a contract, we agree to the zoning state of affairs as allowing multifamily housing

	we later discover that there really wasn’t zoning for multifamily housing

		this is not a MM situation.  RISK IS ON THE BUYER.

	MUTUAL MISTAKE MEANS MISTAKE AS TO THE DRAFTING OF THE DOCUMENT

		e.g., typo in the legal description

		the remedy is reformation


ambiguity:

	not an easy out.

	broad does not equal ambiguity



GIVE YOURSELF A CONTRACT RIGHT

	to have all documents exactly as they appear at closing in my office three days in advance of closing

	this allows a real look at the documents before closing so you can ID problems




MILLER v CRAIG

get the consent of both parties when acting as an escrow agent before you disburse any funds

write terms of release into the contract

don’t let funds loose without getting both parties to sign

you’ve got duties to both parties

“parties agree they will sign a document that confirms their consent before I disburse funds”



RET DAY 8

BAR EXAM:  beware the remedy amount. it’s the difference between the K and the FMV at the time of BREACH

what is FMV? what is the market?

	-comparable sales (of similar sq footage, similar features, similar lot size, etc.  in what area?)
		smaller, weaker, market means you have to reach further afield
	-replacement cost
		only one has a view, a pond, art deco architecture, etc
	-income capitalization
		for commercial properties.  best measure of value is expected income flow over life dc to present.
	-hedonic and contingent valuation
		“joy value” of a lake etc.  contingent valuation rises from social science research.

Buyer and seller have different definitions of these things

pick your definitions based on what you want.

	tax man: pick the low valuation outcomes
	borrowing: pick the higher valuations



DiGuiuseppe v Lawler

a liquidated damages clause is not always the “sole and exclusive remedy” unless it uses that language

cautious:  write in “sole and exclusive remedy”

drafting risk

contingent on acceptable zoning ‘as applied for’

if the guy gets a zoning change, and accepts it, does he waive anything?

does it have to be exactly as he applied for?

seller doesn’t like the buyer hanging up on the difference, and moves on to a different deal with a new guy

RULE:  you have to be ready willing and able to hold up your end of the deal in order to get specific performance

if you’re gonna demand someone to perform, you gotta be ready too


	traditional rule:  every piece of RP is unique, because it occupies a unique spot

	it’s breaking down because condos and ryan homes aint so unique


the guy in this case is really just hanging on a technicality to get out of his 400k deposit

he’s getting pretty much what he wants, or else he’d bail

he puts himself in a bad spot, and gets exposed as lacking the funding


Recording here was substantially douchey because it clouds the title.

He’s given notice to the world that the title is now screwed up



COX v RKA

you transfer by deed, creating rights between the parties

when you record, it defines rights as to other third parties

when you record you get extra rights against the people who don’t record

it improves your position in litigation to record

background rule:  first in time, first in right


building lender records their loan first

but

they’re in a race-notice recording jdx

so

since the (later) lender already knew about the law and the contract, they cannot be first

[a later lender can be an earlier lender, so longs as they are (1) without notice and (2) to the recording office first]


the recording act changes the default common law rule

the vendee’s lien arises at the moment of signing the contract

so

the bank is really second in time

but they’re the first to record.  but thats not all there is to it in a RN jDX

(XR TELLURIDE)

(XR chapter 4, telluride: some jdx give special priority to PMM coming from the seller)


lender’s review:  tell the builder to write his contracts with the buyer to compel the buyer to knowingly subordinate all legal and equitable rights to the lender



maybe the lender only knew they’d be junior to 12k, but not the rest of it

they paid all these extras that weren’t required

the court held that lender was junior to all of it




IT CANNOT BE SLANDER IF YOU PROPERLY FILE LIS PENDENS

you can only file lis pendent if the lawsuit has an outcome that goes directly to the title of the property



Sexton

breaks down some traditional rules

the purchase of the family home is so central to the american dream that developers squandering the money gets past normal contract remedies and gets into tort law

you should be able to see as a bad developer that your bad act is going to cause mental anguish

buyer can get tort damages beyond the usual contract remedies


in this case, the buyer sued the lender for failure to adequately supervise


on one hand, too little supervision and they’re liable (because the developer gambled it all away)

on the other hand, too much and they’re liable in a supervisory capacity as a manager/developer



RET DAY 9


Make the determination at two points:

what title do i contract for?
what title does the deed convey?


Every law you get from the records has to be judged in terms of the law EFFECTIVE AT THE TIME IT WAS EXECUTED


T in C both must sign
JT either can sign



background rule: seller undertakes to sell a FSA


by covenant (it’s a contractual promise)

and

an implied condition

	(you don’t have to buy if its not the presumed FSA)

	risk is on the seller


you gotta keep making deposits

there’s no breach until the moment of closing

up until the moment of closing, the seller doesn’t have to secure clear FSA title




Marketable = FSA title clear and good

you can contract for less, or for more (record title) but then you have contract title



Marketable title is an issue prior to closing,

once you close, you take the deed, everything else merges out

the deed is a general warranty deed or a special warranty deed



the three present covenants (p201) are breached at the time of closing
	(SoL runs from date of closing)

the three future covenants are breached when the claim arises or the homie gets the boot
	(SoL starts with the issue)


GWD:  ill defend this title against anyone at all
SWD: same six warranties, but it limits the scope of the warranty

		“I did not personally create a conflicting interest with anyone else”

QCD: puts all the risk on the buyer.  I’m giving up what I have, but you get the risk.

	no covenants for quitclaim deeds

warranty: I agree to be liable and pay up if someone has a conflicting claim against your interest


all 50 states:  a statute imports the six covenants so long as you use the statute’s magic words


EXAM:

keep a timeline of the transaction so you know what doctrines are active
fabricate and memorize a timeline graphic



Staley v Stephens

setback requirement.  house violates.  title marketable?

risk of future suit.  title not marketable

in order to be marketable, the title must be secure

	secure in the quality of the estate

any one of the other lot owners could be a pain in the ass and sue

the possibility of suit means not marketable

the only out would be getting all the lot owners to sign the waiver

you’d need to get the signature of all the owners and ALL THEIR LENDERS TOO

	because lender has a property interest

once you close, you’re fucked

once you close, you’ve accepted whatever goods you got

you’d have to rely on a title covenant

GET TO KNOW THE SIX COVENANTS

THIS IS A REALLY TESTY SECTION OF THE COURSE.

KNOW THIS MATERIAL WELL FOR THE EXAM



Scott v Turner

a variance is an exception to the zoning

	normally a variance runs with the land

	here, they put a condition subsequent that killed the variance when the property was all divided up

	“variance simple determinable”

	when they cut up the property, the 50ft rule kicked in

	this violates the title promises, the buyer doesn’t have to go ahead


Jones v Warmack

drafting case

preplanning for what happens if an issue materializes

the two covenants were parallel

the ten day window to refuse based on an uncured title defect did not also pause the deposit schedule






RET DAY 10


legal description must be in the contract and in the deed

WHEN YOU SEE N 1/2 SE 1/4 W 1/4 plot the shit out so you can see it visually



WHAT IS AN ENCUMBRANCE?

	if the restriction is in the granting language, then it defines the estate

	if it’s outside the granting language, it’s probably an encumbrance

	if it’s in the body of the grant and describes a covenant, it’s an encumbrance



when giving a legal description, make sure you act like you don’t know where on earth you are

it should start: US, NY, Onondaga, etc….



make sure the surveyor certifies to you in addition to your client so you can sue more readily on account of the privity

lawyer for your client, lawyer for yourself

	arrange the deal so that there’s always someone liable other than you and the client

		(CPA for the financials, surveyor for the lines, etc…)

	you want to supervise the deal and be responsible for the legal judgements

	you manage the other professionals so that you and the client don’t get left out in the cold

	it’s always ‘based on the documents from X that i reviewed, my legal opinion is Y…’

	never ‘this is a valid corporation’

	instead ‘based on documents xyz, i opine this.’

	this narrows your liability



get your survey to certify distances between lot lines and structures

get the surveyor to say ‘survey for client and lawyer’

get them to add a legal description and have them certify it according to some organization’s standards

	that way, whatever happens, you can show their negligence vis a viz the standards




verify that the property exists
legal desc
encroachments
structures are in compliance with setbacks
show any [easement] on the public records visually (and have them attach the book and page)

also, have him look for prescriptive easements and adverse possession and mark the results visually


hire him, tell him ‘these are the things we want,’ tell him you want a standard, tell him you want it certified

	certify to you, client, and bank


recognize the issue, set up the deal so that the surveyors are liable for the fallout




McGhee v Young

priority of references to monuments over calls on paper




present and future covenants overlap in what they warrant

the difference matters in the Statuete of limitations

present ones are breached at closing.  you get three years.

SoL for future covenants starts when future ones are breached.

ALWAYS BE CONSCIOUS OF THIRD PARTIES’ INTERESTS IN A DEAL

	problem 9:  you can’t negotiate a new line because of the lenders’ interests in the properties




EXAM:

DECODE THE FACT PATTERN ON THE FLY, make a chart

also, make a chart of the p241 snippets for race, race-notice, and notice



BFP:

		1- a person who paid value
		2- without notice of prior existing claim
		3- in good faith (if there was reason to inquire, you did)

bona fide purchaser

nobody who buys after I record can be a BFP



ART 9 of the UCC used to be race, may have changed


the test in notice jdx is WHEN C PAYS THE VALUE

	if the doc is recorded, and then C pays value, B wins

	if the doc is unrecorded, and C pays value, C wins



notice means

	-actual
	-constructive
	-inquiry



Chergosky gives BFP shelter rule

AND

the exception, which prohibits laundering title by means of BFP status






RET DAY 12


title abstract: buyer only recovers through litigation if the abstractor was negligent

title certificate opinion: standard for recovery is negligence (malpractice)


TITLE INSURANCE: insurer has absolute liability, strictly liable if it’s covered in the policy



the three often overlap

	an abstract is ordered

	someone interprets it

	then you can get insurance.  insurance is issued off an abstract.



in a commercial transaction, the attorney for the borrower would also give an opinion on the title insurance

he gives a legal opinion as to the effectiveness (proper signing, etc)




the abstractor’s contractual undertaking is putting together all the documents on the public records that affect your property

	if the abstractor fails to include a doc because it’s misindexed, no negligence

	if he fails to include because he sucks at his job, then malpractice

	they don’t endeavor to assert any meaning re the docs


	the next step is to get an opinion or a title insurance policy



if the lawyer gives an opinion, she is held to the standard set by her peers


if you don’t get your client title insurance, get them to sign off on a CYA letter

“in the US, we have no proofs of ownership.  you may suffer a loss if you don’t get insurance.  I’ve advised you about the price and availability of insurance, and you here certify that you don’t want that coverage.”


	it’s especially shitty if your bank clients are getting title insurance and your residential clients aren’t



make sure you understand the exclusions

	know what you’re covered for and what you’re not covered for


the public records create an information pool

	lawyers look at the info and make a judgment


title insurance is not supposed to be risk-based

	25% of closings end up with a title problem (usually small dollar amounts)


almost all insurance is forward-looking (insure my car today for tomorrow’s crash)

	title insurance is based on a snapshot of all the info available at a given time

	then they agree to insure X from the date they look at, then backwards in history

		any interest that arises after that date is not insured



You’re only entitled to that which you put in the contract

	ADD A TITLE INSURANCE REQUIREMENT TO THE CONTRACT

		we get a week to look over the commitment

		we must have a policy without the following bullshit…

		THEY WILL REFUSE to take that shit out unless you can explain why

			so, say “you’ve got the affidavit, we got the survey, etc.  take that shit out!”



the commitment comes before the closing

	tells you status before closing and whats needed at closing

after you close you get a policy

	the policy says the company went back to the public records, and found a doc with the buyer as owner

	it certifies that the public records reflect that the buyer has FSA


	if they don’t really have the FSA, the title insurance covers that shit


you can sue the seller on the warranties you got, you can sue the title company based on the policy


TITLE INSURANCE IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR A WARRANTY DEED

	it only covers for a limited window of risks

	you want a warranty deed to cover your ass if the title company weasels out


commitment:

	Schedule A tells how the property is owned

		proposed insured are the buyers under the contract

		tells how its owned right now and by whom

		gives a legal description

	Schedule B tells requirements for what the insured must do (pay, divulge info)

	Schedule B Sec 2 lists the exceptions to the policy (not shown in records, visible encroachments, taxes, etc)

		if you’re big bank, you negotiate these terms.  you won’t close unless they reduce # of exceptions

		the risks in Sec 2 can’t be eliminated, but they can be insured.  negotiate hard


the lender won’t provide any money if the homeowner won’t put up with getting shafted with these risks



Lawyers that do title work and issue their own policies tend to be better real property lawyers

	it creates a market incentive for lawyers to be better at their work




commitment comes first, policy comes after closing



std for marketable title: is there a cloud on the title on the face of the documents?

						would a prudent property person identify a potential for litigation?

if there’s any shred of suggestion of anything that would cause you to pause, it’s a cloud on the title



real property lawyers look for the littlest fly specks

	any little thing trips them up

	because the consequences are big and there are shitloads of pitfalls



just because a few lawyers passed over it doesn’t mean its legitimized

look at the old restrictions as closely as you would the new ones



a title insurance policy for an owner insures that your estate trumps any inconsistent claims

a title insurance policy for a lender insures that their mortgage is first


RET DAY 13

EXAM:

LOOK AT THE FACT PATTERN CLOSELY.  DON’T DO ANY ANALYSIS ON a legal conclusion that’s given


IN PRACTICE:  FIND AND INTEGRATE THE TITLE STANDARDS



the title standards give guidelines

	use the handbook from the title insurance company

	but, they aren’t the law

	they’re useful as a negotiation lever

	they won’t do much good in court



if you’re looking at an old document, look up the old title standards from back then

	they title standards form the old days will give you a guide to what the ancient law was



curative acts: after a certain time period expires (3 years), a document on the public record is cured (an undated deed is made legitimate)

	it lists a bunch of de minims defects that tend to crop up and allows the doc to be presumed valid

curative acts cure defects.  it corrects for specific minor defects. it’s kind of like a laches mechanism

it’s different from a marketable record title act



a marketable record title act is designed to extinguish old real property interests (p302)

	“time-bomb takings” issue

	no notice, no due process

	it’s not just a title practice “go this far back to establish marketable title”

	IT DELETES OLD PROPERTY INTERESTS

		exceptions include the federal government’s interests in waterways etc

		they’re state acts.  states can’t take from the federal gov.  state statute can’t eliminate rights of the feds.

		states also keep their rights to waterways, mineral rights, etc

		railways and similar keep their rights


	even if there’s a forty-year loopback, you still want to look all the way back to check on the exceptions

		is there a train right?  mineral rights?  etc



MATISSEK v WALLER

	florida airplane hangar neighborhood

	platted out with restrictions in the early 70s

		[quitclaim deeds don’t purport to be a title transaction]

	marketable record title act extinguishes the restrictions b/c they weren’t included in the modern chain’o’title

    HOUSING PRODUCTS

    up until now, we’ve been handling the transaction RE contracts and the process

    now, we’re looking at housing products for residential ownership

    we think from the client’s side, and also from the developer/lender side


    think also about the market and how to hit the demographics

    the modern market tries to sell a lifestyle, not just a box




    with unconventional estate interests, start with the statute and then check the cases to see how they work

    when you set these up, you create real property interests AND something like a little government with rules



    M&T mortgage corp v white

    housing products turned out different form what was promised

    redlining is exclusion of people based on their race

    reverse redlining is targeted people based on their race


    	disparate treatment: you have to show intent to treat a protected group differently
    	disparate impact: legit business reasons happen to cause racially meaningful consequences

    			a very strong correlation allows an inference of disparate treatment from disparate impact
    			there must be a nexus between the policy and the discriminatory impact
    			SCOTUS:  UNDER FHA DISPARATE IMPACT CAN BE ENOUGH
    				-protected class
    				-you follow a policy that has an unfair impact
    				-intent for a bad policy is not necessary
    				-there are less discriminatory policies available for managing risk

    Predatory lending = reverse redlining

    	we don’t cut you out of the market, but we bring in disadvantaged individuals for our shit products

    		-protected class
    		-targeted
    		-less favorable terms offered


    There’s not unconscionable contract terms or predatory lending in a competitive market

    	the market would produce the terms that people want

    	if there’s a competitive market, shitty terms would get pushed out by someone who can offer better terms

    	a racist lender would lose the business of black people

    	an economist would throw this shit out because you’d have to show that this is not a competitive market first

    		only after showing that its not a competitive market could you talk discrimination

    		being able to force terms on people is predicate to discriminatory lending

    	EXAM:  ADD THE FHA 4 p320 elements to the outline



    holy shit:  a lender can foreclose on your mortgage when they learn of the HOA lien against an owner


    covenants and restrictions that run with the land are a property right that a court will enforce




    road map:

    i own a whole parcel
    i subdivide it into lots
    i place covenants and restriction of record on the land
    	these create also an owners association, and mechanisms and bylaws for amendments and rules
    they bind the future owners, so long as the future deeds specifically reference them
    	(or the developer rerecords them)



    TURUDIC v STEPHENS dba SUSAN ESTATES

    	the COUGAR case

    	the homeowners association has tremendous power

    	the buyers almost always lose

    	here, they happen to win

    	the POA did a bad job and could have won

    		if they’d objected on the grounds of aesthetic inconsistency, they might have won

    		since they objected on the basis of nuisance and ‘residential use’ they lost

    	they lost on nuisance because its not a nuisance per se because state law permits exotic pets

    		nor were the cages unreasonable or insecure.  not a nuisance

    	court:  if you’re denying it because it’s a nuisance, you lose

RET DAY 15

condo owners own their unit in fee and need to insure it

the elements of what needs to go into a declaration of condominium is in the state statute

	part of what you have to do is define a unit

	so the real definition of a UNIT is in the docs

		sometimes you own to the surface, sometimes you own to the center of the wall

		sometimes its unclear, and the [balcony] gets called into question

			other times theres a section: UNIT INCLUDES, and they enumerate a list including balcony

			the default position is that its a common element

			if its assigned to a unit, it might only be a limited common element

				insurance implications?  storm rips off a balcony, who pays?


		if its not insured, and its destroyed, everyone has to pay to repair “my” balcony

			because it’s limited common ownership

		the association is empowered to make assessments against the owners

		they can also foreclose on a lien that results form your unwillingness to pay your share

	who gets votes and how many, who gets assessed and how much <——  this all needs to be spelled out.

	before you buy in, you need to check out all the details of that declaration of condominium


	the bank will be concerned about whether OA liens take priority over a mortgage



COOPS

	they emerged before condos as a way to share ownership

	it allows owners to buy shares in a corporation that come with a proprietary lease to a unit

	as a result of being a shareholder, you have a right to a lease

		your rights don’t include the right to determine who lives there

			you can’t give it to your kids or sublease it to an iranian

			the coop board can refuse X

				they’re allowed to own it and sell it but not occupy it probably

	the main difference in the legal structures of coops and condos:

		your client will get stock in a corporation, and not deed for fee title to a box of air

		you see at closing a stock certificate, and a document that assigns a proprietary lease

	as far as financing goes:

		you won’t get a mortgage because stock is a PERSONAL PROPERTY interest

		you don’t get a loan, you get an ARTICLE 9 security interest

	the title abstract looks different too

		you gotta search the history of the building and make sure the corporation owns it

		you gotta search the history of the unit too


	COOPS have bylaws that establish procedures for booting someone out

		the way they can terminate your estate makes COOP ownership unlike a normal property interest

			-give notice
			-allow them to speak
			-make up a rationale
			-boot them the fuck out
			-they have almost no recourse, very hard to overturn

		you have limited rights to alter your space

	in a COOP, everyone is individually responsible for the entire mortgage

		so if one guys drifts away, everyone else has to point up a bit more dough to avoid foreclosure

		there’s a lot of financial interdependence

			this gives the coop an ABSOLUTE RIGHT OF APPROVAL

				because you’re counting on that person in a very direct way to pay up

			which contrasts to a CONDO’S RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL


	the COOP board doesn’t have to give an objection reason

		they only get in trouble if they explicitly say:  we don’t want you here because you’re black

		if they get sued, they don’t even have to come up with a business reason when put on the spot


when representing a coop board:

	coach them not to give reasons
	don’t take notes
	don’t discuss why

the main reason for buying a coop is to exclude you least favorite crowds



you buy in knowing the rules

	its an extremely discretionary form of ownership

	this seems appealing up front, but it can make it incredibly hard to find a buyer

	you can’t sell, you can’t find a buyer, you can’t pay your fees, dues, lease:
		YOU GET FORECLOSED




TIMESHARES

	we’ve divided fee simple ownership and broken it into airspaces that we can sell on a fiction

	now, we’re breaking those spaces into time chunks

	the estate springs into being on Dec 1 each year and ends on Dec 15 each year.

		DOES NOT JIVE WITH COMMON LAW

	it’s fee simple title, but only to a chunk of time

	opens up your sale to a bigger chunk of the market. 10k is more manageable than 300k for the whole house

	is this a residential use?  according to conner, its not

	you can give the title to a week, you can give them a license, or you can sell them points in a system

		disney does this.  peak times cost more points, sweet spots cost more, etc



in first year, we learned about estate types

this year, we’re seeing insane amounts of variety in division of fee simple interests

RET DAY 16

Mortgages are cheaper than unsecured credit because the costs (transaction costs) are cheaper

a credit transaction is any where there's not simultaneous delivery of exchange

the mortgage is a security device

the mortgage gives lender rights in an asset

	foreclosure gives you the due process (notice and opportunity to be heard)


SECURED CREIDT IS CHEAPER THAN UNSECURED


the secondary mortgage market started in the 80s

the promissory note reflects cash flow

they learned to document the cash flow and market it as a "stock"


the fee simple determinable gave birth to the mortgage in the 14th century

the interest can be terminated by paying on an appointed time an appointed amount

you get a future interest in exchange for your loan



the lender is entitled to perfect performance

	perfect amount, timing, compliance with terms


estate is defeasible.



landowners and lenders later developed a different system

old way: estate interest was hinged on payment

new way: etsate is transferred clear FSA, with a covenant to transfer back if repaid

this way, lender holds onto the property

	you'd have to take the burden of getting it back if the lender doesnt readily give it up

again, difference between tweaking quality estate and tweaking the contract of conveyance



equity made a habit of allowing defaulters to redeem themselves in god's eyes and releive the nobles of the obligation of perfect tender

this is known as the equitable right of redemption

it gives you a time period (in all states) to redeem yourself and make up the missed payments



in law, time is of the essence
in equity, time is not of the essence


equity gave the borrower more time to pay/perform
lenders became frustrated with this
they wanted a way to cut off the time to redeem
cutting off became known as foreclosure


there had to be a way for the equitable right of redemption to end

what we know as foreclosure is the closing off of the equitable right of redemption

FORECLOSURE is a proceeding that allows the lender to close out the possibility of you redeeming yourself


the equitable right of redemption is codified in statute in most states
but
the statutory right of redemption (also codified) allows you to perform or pay AFTER FORECLOSURE


modern mortgage law is firly similar in function across all states

there are some differences tho

some of them come from different theories of mortgage (lien, title, hybrid)


practice:

person takes possession
treats it like they really own it
only if they default will something bad happen
if the default, lender can foreclose

but

especially in a commercial mortgage setting, the differences matter



title theory: lender has title from start

	borrower grants his property interest to the lender in exchange for the money
	title is transferred when you deliver the mortgage subject to being defeated (by payment)
	lender is owner with a present right to possession and use
	but lender wont act on it as long as you keep performing: paying your money, taxes


lien theory: lender has title at foreclosure

	easier on the borrower
	buyer has title
	lender gives a loan
	lender has a lien
		a lien is a property right that
		allows a lender to execute on the lien/foreclose on the mortgage
		it's not a future interest.  it's a present interest
		it gives you a right in the veent youre not paid
	only on foreclosure does lender get title

intermediate theory: lender has title on default

	mortgagor retains title,
	but upon default
	title immediately goes to the lender



NY is a lien theory jdx

in a title theory jdx, you can arrange the mortgage to allow lender to take possession on default

	courts honor it because you already have a right to possession
	youre just terminating the arrangement that allows borrower use

in lien theory jdx, courts are less likely to boot the borrower

	borrower had the title and lender must wrestle it away



you need to know the theory of the jdx youre in, and lawyer with that in mind

mortgage law is governed by the location of the property

the promissory note can its remedies can be governed by some other law

a promissory note is also governed by article 3



FORECLOSURE PREVIEW:

	foreclosure terminates property rights,
	so there must be due process (notice and opportunity to be heard)


	strict foreclosure is the old english way:
		you didnt pay, lender takes the property
		lender takes, even if you only owe 1000 bucks
		lender doesnt need to account for anything

	[you can foreclose a lien under article 9]


	judicial, power of sale, and non-judicial all involve a sale of the property

		strict foreclosure is seen as unfair
		its not supposed to be a gamble
		it's supposed to be about credit and repayment


NY is a judicial foreclosure state

	no foreclosure can take place outside the court system
	you need to file in court
	there has to be a hearing with notice and pleadings
	there has to be a title search


	you get a chance to disprove your default


Power of Sale state permit the document to give the lender power to conduct a sale in the event of default.  PoS is a nonjudicial proceeding where lender sells.

	default, period of ER, then a sale per statute conducted by lender (no court involved)


NONJUDICIAL: state requires a third party to act as trustee for the mortgage

	mortgage doc names title co as a trustee over deed of trust
	they conduct the non-judicial foreclosure
	the practical purpose is that it goes fast and easy compared to a jdcl foreclosure (2.5 years)


the person who defaults doesnt pay for the transaction costs of a default, the other mortgage market participants do

a deed of trust will not be treated as such in NY.  only jdcl forclsrs



WASTE:

lender has an interest regardless of theory

you cant commit waste



FAIT

waste is only good faith if it results from economic downturn


permissive waste:  you let the property deteriorate
affirmative waste:  you knock down the buildings or extract all the minerals




RET DAY 17


clients view the mortgage as an obligation

its hard to see it sometimes as an investment

recently, a big wave of legislation has prohibited illegitimate discrimination


points are based on the amount of the loan, not the price of the house



"real" interest rate:  how much youre paying for the money, affects taxes


APR:  formula produced by fed gov to req all lenders to put everything in

	it gives the consumer a view into the real cost of their loan

	it treats all points and fees as interest and shows you the "real" cost

	makes it easier to comparison shop, ostensibly

		but actually tends to add confusion


regulation Z requires the lender to disclose all the costs


FRM is still very popular

	they're really popular when interest rates are low

	you can lock in a sweet deal

when interest rates are high, people opt for an ARM in hopes that rates will drop


FRM puts the marketplace risk on the lender

	especially in low interest times
	especially if borrower can refinance readily and cheaply


ARM puts the risk on the borrower

	theyre typically a little lower up front (4 instead of 5)
	you only have to qualify for the initial rate



choice of the form of the mortgage is not driven by credit score, but pricing is



All these configurations get the same market rate of interest

	if not, the banks would offer them

from the lender point of view, the profit works out the same

	it's all about segmenting the market


for the lenders, its all about getting as much volume as possible



subsidized housing typically includes clauses defining where appreciation goes (to gov)


paying on a mortgage in advance does not relieve the obligation to pay next month


























RET DAY 18

no matter the jdx (lien or title theory):

	THE BORROWER IS THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY


depeding on what the mortgage says, waste can means default

substantial remodeling is troublesome for the lender

lenders will want their lawyers to give them a spot to jump in for so little reason as:

	lender feels insecure in their own discretion


POINTS ARE ON THE LOAN AMOUNT, NOT THE PURCHASE PRICE

	the lender's perspective!


with a RAM, the bank gives you dough on the value of your house

	the debt rises each month

	the pound of flesh comes out of the estate at the end of your life




The bank will ask:

	are we doing our truth in lending disclousres properly?




assignees are protected by a safe harbor provision

	they don't have the same disclosure obligations as the loan orginator operating in the primary mortgage market


transferring the loan to another party cuts off some of the rights that the borrower would have against the originator

	the asusmption here is that the secondary mortgage market adds more value for us than the right of a borrower to bring an action for shitty loan practices

	if there was fraud, the second holder does not have the same protections



    RET DAY 19


    FAZIO

    	borrower fakes his income

    	cant pay the mortgage

    	gets pissed and sues the bank for making a loan to him based on his own lies


    	This is a no-doc loan

    		(no documentation)

    	These mortgages are credit relationships

    		the terms are all about addressing the risk of not getting paid back


    BE ABLE TO ID WHERE THE BANK MAKES MONEY

    	which paragraphs are doing the heavy lifting?

    	the key functional parts are the PP where the bank sets up its rights to take that property back

    	the terms decide who absorbs the risk

    	know the types

    	know the implications



    FNM and FMCC bought up all this garbage


    Republicans saw this as an economic stimulus package

    Democrats saw it as a way to get all the poor people into housing




    THe mortgage is a securing device that incorporates the promises of the promissory note

    	you add stuff about the mortgage

    	this adds other obligations


    The mortgage follows the note

    	if you transfer the note to a holder in due course, the mortgage follows

    	even if you dont do a second transfer, the mortgage transfers (following the note)


    the note can't come with a lot of baggage

    	that's why the duties are in the mortgage


    the note is in personam

    	enforced against a person

    the mortgage is in rem

    	enforced against the property rights


    you can pick and choose which to sue on or both



    USURY

    	is a trap for lenders who arent careful

    	be careful to draft mortgages that aren't in the neighborhood of usury

    		(especially in NY)

    	have a provision that says that "nothing in the mortgage is intended to charge the buyer more than the legal limit on interest"

    		this helps in some cases


    	Foreclosure preview:

    		the only thing the lender has to do:

    			here's the promise to pay
    			here's evidence that he didn't pay

    			it's a very low burden on lender

    				the borrower has the burden of overcoming the presumption that they ought to be booted

    			foreclosure is an equitable remedy

    				the judge can hear anything he wants

    				when he's heard enough, he ends it

    			then he forecloses the equitable right of redemption

    				A lot of times the borrower may be right but maybe he can afford the evidence he needs

    				borrower defends often: yes i promised, yes i didnt pay, but THE LENDER MADE ME DEFAULT

    					[if the lender had let me take a larger portion of the rent...]

    					[if the lender had released funds earlier...]



    	RON KING v R&R

    		what is the calculation for usury?

    		how about where default causes the itnerest rate to increase?

    		the pltf makes their usury claim on the basis of the default rate

    		dfndt comes back and says no, usury is based on the stated percentage in your note

    		YOUR DEFAULT RATE IS NOT THE ONE THE COURT SHOULD LOOK AT

    			if you'd paid like you shoulda, it wouldnt be usurious


    		The court bases its usury analysis on the stated interest rate not the default


    		how about if there were other obligations?  could they make a rate usuruious?

    			some possible default situations:

    				-waste
    				-failure to pay
    				-material alteration that alters the value of the property
    					sometimes this one comes on nevousness alone
    				-late taxes
    				-late HoA fees
    				-HoA lien on the property

    			when the default occurs, the rates go up, because the risk has changed



    WESTMARK v TEENFORM

    	late fees
    	loan acceleration
    	prepayment fees
    	attorney's fees



    	late fees != default interest rate

    		you can charge a late fee

    			at a certain point late becomes in default and you can charge the hgiher rate


    	loan acceleration = moving up the maturity date of the loan

    		maturity date = law day, when the total amount becomes due

    		you must have a provision that allows acceleration


    	prepayment

    		you do not have a right to pay early because of the perfect tender rule

    		you can, however, write in a provision that allows you to prepay with minimal penalty or none

    		prepayment hurts cash flow and lowers predicability

    		the lender wants call protection (protection from early payment)

    			call protection goes with match funding

    			they know the income from their loans will allow them to match some other obligation they have

    			early payment might disrupt the ability to provide some other service

    		early payment can also impact the tax profile of a company

    		prepayment is decidedly in the best interest of a borrower

    		its against the interests of the lender

    	when you're in default, during the period of the equitable right of redemption:

    		you can redeem yourself

    		but you cant just pay the month you missed

    			you have to pay interest, late fees, administrative fees, principal, etc

    		The EQUITABLE RIGHT OF REDEMPTION is an empty right because you don't have the dough



    PAWTUCKET

    	THERE HAS TO BE AN OBLIGATION TO PAY

    	a mortgage is meaningless unless it's connected to an obligation to pay some ascertainable amt

    	the deal is not about a promissory note

    		a promissory note is the usual way

    		but its not the only way

    	the mortgage is an attempt to secure the prmoise to pay

    	if someone pays the promissory note down to zero, the note is dead

    	once the value goes to zero, there is no mortgage

    		this has big implications for first in time first in right analyses


    	#2 says i go first

    	#3 knows there'll be nothing left

    	#3 wants to claim that #2 had no real mortgage

    		so that they get a taste of the surplus after #1 had his fill




    assumption of a mortgage means youre taking personal liability for the responsibility to pay

    subject to means that youre not personally liable

    	(note is in personam, mortgage is in rem)


    in rem is secured credit

    in personam is general credit

    	this matters to third parties who need to be able to tell how much credit is already there

    	you need a number so you know how junior lenders stand

    when you pay off a mortgage, you want a doc showing satisfaction that you can then record




    SWANSON v KRENIK

    	Rush and Luther defaulted on the mortgage
    	They can't pay the deficiency
    	theyre bankrupt, no money to be had there

    	the property is not of sufficient value to pay of the debt owed to the bank

    		the bank goes after the parties in personam on the promise

    		RL no blood from a stone




    	why are swanson and krenik in the conversation?

    	RL assumed from S, who had assumed from K

    	Bank turns to S, after RL

    	S says, hey, why not make me split it with K?

    		there's an equities arg in favor of S
    		K didnt choose who gets it next

    		importantly, S is above K in the heirarchy


    	S is fully liable

    	As long as S has money to pay, she's gotta pay

    	if she's good for part of it, she gives up all she has, and then the bank turns to Krenik


    	Original borrower K transfers to S who assumes the mortgage

    		S could have paid of the mortgage and got their own lender
    		instead she took on some baggae in exchange for favorable terms (lower rates, eg)
    			otherwise, someone might assume to avoid prepayment penalties, etc


    	There's three levels of responsibility in this case
    		RL primary
    		S secondary
    		K tertiary


    	K probably thought he was off the hook when he transferred
    		but
    		unless you get a written release, you're not off the hook

    		banks normally charge for the release

    			a release is recordable

    		your divorce settlement does not release you


    	subject to: bank can take property but cant sue you
    	assumed: bank can take property and can sue you personally for any deficiency

    	these are often drafted in an unclear way, sometimes assume and subject to get mixed up



    traditional rule:  if the lender modifies the loan with a party who assumed the mortgage, the bank can't go after the first party

    	they made a choice and changed the dynamic on both S and K

    be careful tweaking a loan

    if you represent lenders, WRITE A PARAGRAPH

    	"changing a term does not release a prior party from responsibility..."



    LEVINE v FIRST NATIONAL

    bond for deed: really a credit arrangement,
    	but seller tries to mask itself as an owner instead of a creditor

    kind of like a PMM, but no need to go through foreclosure proceedings
    	you just enforce the breach of contract
    	a contract breach is easier to manage, also seller still held title
    	seller can also collect damages

    sellers try to circumvent borrower's rights by not using the mortgage version of the transfer
    	anticipate:  court will treat this like a mortgage
    		just the use of the form and the word contract does not make it so
    		court will try to give all the prtections it can


    DOES THIS TRIGGER THE DUE ON SALE CLAUSE?

    	is it a transfer of the property?
    	on its face, the answer is no

    	but, due on sale is not limited to transfer of the full fee simple

    	YES, it triggers the DoS clause


    FRENCH

    Garn St Germain exception

    	death transfers do not trigger due on sale clause



    DEFAULT

    	HAS TO BE DEFINED

    	implicit default: you promised to pay X and did not

    	but also typically:

    	waste
    	transfer
    	tax failure

    	sometimes default is also defined as any violation of any of the terms or any disruption of the relationship

    	they dont always want to foreclose, but it's always good leverage

    	maximize the opportunities to have the borrower ask you for things
    	maximize you opportunities to move forward before borrower does something screwy

    	your account is typically linked by cross default to your mortgage






    ACCELERATION

    	gives the lender a right to bring up due date

    	that way they dont have to try to sue on each missed payment

    	automatic acceleration used to be common

    		now borrowers usually get notice and an grace period opportunity to pay late fees

    		then reinstatement

    		once you burn up the grace period, its over though

    	waiver: you've completely given up the right (by your behavior of accepting late payments)
    	estoppel: argument in equity.  bc of what youve done, you cant enforce the rule right now
    		but the rule is not gone forever. you can give notice and put the rule back in place.

    		write to the debtor, remind him of his obligation, reassert that time is of the essence
    		then the term is reinstated, and courts will allow

    		but if the debtor successfully argues waiver instead of estoppel, nothing you do can revive

    	If you're representing banks, talk estoppel if you have to but not waiver





    FORECLOSURE CHAPTER


    	first step: do a title report
    		but remember the other unrecorded interests
    		and the default rules
    	make a list of priority
    	determine who is necessary and who is proper
    		nec: needed
    		proper: can be joined

    	necessary parties come later in time
    	the party foreclosing does not fall under the nec/prop categorizations

    	anyone who has a right to notice and to be heard (anyone whose property rights are being wiped out) is a necessary party

    	All the property interests that come after the forclosure are erased
    		INCLUDING easements
    		all junior interests are cleared out

    	the idea is to give the person who buys the property at the sale the same title that borrower took


        RET DAY 21



        In commercial context, you can write a paragraph for anything

        Lawyers as entrepreneurs weave through the quagmire to create strategies for creating value

        senior interests are proper parties
        junior interests are necessary parties because they have property interests that will be extinguished
        	therefore they have a right to notice and a right to be heard

        junior interests are extinguished at forclosure


        Big Bank's foreclosure may trigger default on a prior mortgage too

        when First bank decides to foreclose, it becomes a foreclosure on First Bank's mortgage



        One Action Rule:

        	you have an in personam action on the note
        	you have an action in rem on the mortgage

        	some states prevent a lender from suing on the breach and leaving you stuck with the contaminated property



        PRELUDE TO FORECLOSURE:

        	-event of deafult
        	-notice of default
        	-right to cure
        	-acceleration of debt

        		default: failure to perform
        		notice
        		right to cure: correct and reinstate per the docs
        		acceleration: must be expressly permitted

        		then notice of foreclosure
        		and actual foreclosure


        In the context of judicial foreclosure:

        	Some states:

        		If you're a junior lender, it's your job to check for notices

        			if you see notice, you can implead yourself

        	Others:

        		senior lender has the job of notifying everyone



        STATUTORY RIGHT OF REDEMPTION:

        	comes after foreclosure of the equitable right of redemption

        	encourages a fair bid at the foreclosure sale

        	creates pressure to bid closer to fair market value

        		if you buy it for a buck, owner can get it back for a buck

        	MIND THE TIMLINES ON EXAM



        DEFICIENCIES

        	traditional: 95 mortgage amnt outstanding - 90 sale price = 5 deficiency

        	FMV: 100FMV.  95mtg amt - 90 sale price = 5 deficiency.  but 100 - 95 = 5 sur



        Equitable Subrogation:

        	adds another scenario where legal time is not the same as calendar time

        	see powerpoint


RET DAY 22

ENGLISH v BANKERS

	RULE: you have to have the owner pegged in order to foreclose

		you also need the junior interests present

		they have to take another swing of the bat at the foreclosure

	English still needs to be joined.
	Lesa took "subject to"

		English gets hit for the deficiency

		Lesa is foreclosed

	This first foreclosure is VOID

	If they'd had the right person and passed her over, she'd be clear
	however, since they had the wrong borrower, the whole thing is void
		and therefore she gets tagged on the second round

	surety folks are always proper parties, but not always necessary


FIRST BANK v FISCHER & FRITCHEL

	FMV test considered

		They're using "debt - sale = deficiency"

		they do not adopt the FMV mode

		fmv: 918k

		debt minus sale (667k)

		or?

		debt minus fmv (215k)


	[foreclosure is often a prelude to bankruptcy]

		structure the documents to protect the lender during foreclosure

		but that also means knowing about how real property interests are treated under bankruptcy law

		package everything with a mind toward the darkest possible outcomes

			default -> foreclosure -> bankruptcy

		make sure you cross the t's and dot the i's
		make sure your priority cannot be questioned by junior lenders


	They keep the common law rule

		big money owed



	Inadequacy of foreclosure sale price

		In most states you need:

		-strikes as unconscionably low
		-some other evidence of bad behavior
			this can be:
				bank buys for 3k
				they have a buyer lined up for 100k
				they sue for 97k deficiency

		but in a lot of places 20% of the FMV is not unconscionable

		This is an equitable determination
		that can make a sale VOIDABLE but not void



ZERVAS v WELLS FARGO BANK

	lender must follow the rules established in the loan docs

	your evidence must show on its face compliance

	you'd have to plead specifically that you gave notice of acceleration

	general pleadings that you'd followed the steps is not enough

	courts don't like foreclosure because of how bad it is for consumers

	they scrutinize your case very closely


	[the note is a UCC article 3 instrument]



PASILLAS v HSBC BANK

	default mediation case

	new requirements since the financial collapse

		they help to manage the rapid turnover of mortages and notes

	two key reqs for the mediation:

		-all the original documents
		-authority to negotiate a repayment schedule

	in states with this kind of crap, double down on strict compliance

		the whole idea is to delay foreclosure and let borrows live in the house

		judges got instructions to toss anything that's missing a dot or cross


JOONDEPH v HICKS

	chase was entitled to equitable subrogation

	Grubbs owned.
	gets some loans.
	hicks gets a judgement/lien

	grubbs sells to londre
	got financing from chase
	they pay off the old shit

		that means that, to the extent chase refinanced the WaMu loan
		they step into the shoes of WaMu

	londre transfers to joondeph
	financing from affiliated
	affiliated to citimortgage

	citi wants to say they can stand in the shoes of chase
		(safe harbor provision)

	citi couldnt make their equitable subrogation argument
		because they had actual notice
		whereas chase did a title search and found no notice
		citi had actual knowledge of thr HICKs lien

	Hicks couldnt beat chase
	hicks can beat citi

		even though citi bought from chase

	whether you have knowledge matters in some states and doesnt in others

		sometimes your knowledge prevents access to equitable subrogation

	sometimes if you refinance a loan and change the terms, the court will treat it as new

		if it's substantially different, it might be considered as a new priority date
		it needs to be clear that they're really refinancing


RET DAY 23



JUNIOR MORTGAGES

	have a lower priority than a senior mortgage

	when people get junior mortgages, the risk of default on the senior loan goes up



IN RE MARTIN

	marshalling of assets (applies to article 9 too)

		adds another layer to the priority rules

			like PMM or vendee's liens

	most states have broad protections for homesteads

		homestead has a technical statutory/constitutional definition

		theyre protected against certain types of creditors

			often all but the PMM provider

			also, both parties must sign off

		it's gotta be the principal home

	the default rule allows the lender to pick which property to foreclose on

	the doctrine of marshalling compels the lender to foreclose first on a less encumbered property

	even though the state recognizing marshalling, the court declines on equity to marshall assets where the result would be popping a family out of their homestead



RANIER v MOUNT STERLING NATIONAL BANK


	unless the loan specifies where money goes, the lender is free to apply payment nay way it wants

	2nd lender extends extra credit

	lender applies 90k to unsecured debt, but the 125k original debt stayed intact

	the 1st lender got shafted because they didnt write a complete subordination clause

		shoulda been no extra dough, no negative amortization, no reduction of unsecured debt



NO MONEY DOWN

	junior mortgages are part of the no money down phenomenon

	the idea is to acquire a property with 100% debt, ith the hope the value goes up
