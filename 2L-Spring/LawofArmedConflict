    Treaty of Westphalia

    Robert Jackson

        prosecutor at Nuremberg

    Universal Declaration of Human Rights

        first legal declaration that people have a right to exist

        allows legal prosecution of murdering tyrants

    Rafael Lempkin

    1949 was the big Geneva Convention

        -no targeting civilians
        -protect POWs
        -protect wounded and sick

    All 190 nations have signed the geneva conventions (only treaty with that claim)

    Hague Rules of 1907 tell who you can target and with what weapon systems

        military neccessity is the cornerstone of this analysis

    "War crimes are command failures" -DC

    What is a war crime?

        it's an act that results in a conviction of guilt at a fair trial

        it's a violation of an international legal standard

        committed by a combatant or [especially?] a leader

        against an unarmed person, a combatant after surrender, or a noncombatant

            killing the wrong person, or in the wrong way

        it's something [determined/discovered] by [due] process

            [and with a jury?]

        "soldiers have a duty to disobey unlawful orders"

            following orders is not an affirmative defense

        Nuremberg Trials: tribute by power to reason

        murder of unarmed unresisting civilians

        negligence on the part of commanders can mean guilt, but sometimes knowledge is required

    KEY LEGAL BASES

        There are legal limits on the tools we use to accomplish military ends

        Everyone has an inherent right to [collective] self-defense

        The Hague Rules

            the conventions of 1899 and 1907

            plus 1954 Hague Cultural Property Convention

            1980 Conventional Weapons Treaty

        Protect and Respect

            the geneva conventions

                automatically apply to state-on-state actions

            Common article 3
                you have to treat anyone found on a NIAC battlefield humanely

                applies to organized belligerency, not to riots

            LOAC applies to IAC and NIAC

                but only where the rebel group controls territory and seeks to overthrow the gov

        Protocols additional to the Geneva Conventions

            Protocol 1: International armed conflict
            Protocol 2: Internal armed conflict

            US has never ratified, we consider them bining as customary intl law

                but we stop following them when it's inconvenient for us

            combat immunity: no prosecution for militarily justifiable warlike acts

        UN Charter Article 2

            peace first

            though un charter allows in appropriate moments to restore peace

            We're developing a two-tier system

                Russia, China, and US get one level of expectation
                Rest of the world held to a higher std

            Only the UN SC can legitimately authorize a war

            though any nation thats attacked can use force under art 51 inherent right of self defense

        Domestic Bases

            president cannot use force without authorization from congress

            Curtiss-Wright, Steel Seizure

            10th is the most important amendment from a power distribution standpoint

    International law is a consensual arrangement where states have agreed to be bound

        time + consent = law

    Key concepts:

        -protected person
        -protecting power
        -combatant immunity
        -grave breaches
        -UN Charter Art. 2, 24, 25, 51
        -relevant domestic law
            Constitution Art. I, II
            War Powers Resolution
            JCS Standing Rules of Engagement
            DoD Law of War Program

    Basic Principles from the Hague Rules

        -Military Necessity
        -Proportionality
        -Discrimination and distincition
        -Unnecessary suffering

        "The four corners of this course" -DC

    PURPOSES:

        -Humanitarianism

            Protecting both combatants and noncombatants from unnecessary suffering
            Safeguarding fundamental human rights of those captured
            Facilitating the restoration of peace

        -Functional Purpose

            Ensuring good order and discipline
            Fighting in a disciplined manner consistent with national values
            Maintinaing domestic and international support

    -Military Necessity

        you can meet a spear, cellphone, and AK with any weapon system
        there is no fairness doctrine
            [you don't have any obligation to hobble your forces to match your enemy]

    -Proportionality

        the anticipated loss of life and damage to property incidental to attacks must not be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage to be gained

            Collateral Damage: unavoidable and unplanned damage to civilian personneland property while attacking a military objective.  Also called incidental damage.

    -Discrimination and distincition

        requires that combatants be dinstinguished from non-combatants, and that military objectives be dinstinguished from protected property or protected places

        Parties to a conflict can only direct their operations against combatants and military objectives

    -Unnecessary suffering

        it is especially forbidden to employ arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering

        military personnel may not use arms that are per se calculated to cause unnecessary suffering , eg projectiles filled with glass, hollow point small caliber ammunition
