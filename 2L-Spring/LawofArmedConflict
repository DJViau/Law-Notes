    Treaty of Westphalia

    Robert Jackson

        prosecutor at Nuremberg

    Universal Declaration of Human Rights

        first legal declaration that people have a right to exist

        allows legal prosecution of murdering tyrants

    Rafael Lempkin

    1949 was the big Geneva Convention

        -no targeting civilians
        -protect POWs
        -protect wounded and sick

    All 190 nations have signed the geneva conventions (only treaty with that claim)

    Hague Rules of 1907 tell who you can target and with what weapon systems

        military neccessity is the cornerstone of this analysis

    "War crimes are command failures" -DC

    What is a war crime?

        it's an act that results in a conviction of guilt at a fair trial

        it's a violation of an international legal standard

        committed by a combatant or [especially?] a leader

        against an unarmed person, a combatant after surrender, or a noncombatant

            killing the wrong person, or in the wrong way

        it's something [determined/discovered] by [due] process

            [and with a jury?]

        "soldiers have a duty to disobey unlawful orders"

            following orders is not an affirmative defense

        Nuremberg Trials: tribute by power to reason

        murder of unarmed unresisting civilians

        negligence on the part of commanders can mean guilt, but sometimes knowledge is required

    KEY LEGAL BASES

        There are legal limits on the tools we use to accomplish military ends

        Everyone has an inherent right to [collective] self-defense

        The Hague Rules

            the conventions of 1899 and 1907

            plus 1954 Hague Cultural Property Convention

            1980 Conventional Weapons Treaty

        Protect and Respect

            the geneva conventions

                automatically apply to state-on-state actions

            Common article 3
                you have to treat anyone found on a NIAC battlefield humanely

                applies to organized belligerency, not to riots

            LOAC applies to IAC and NIAC

                but only where the rebel group controls territory and seeks to overthrow the gov

        Protocols additional to the Geneva Conventions

            Protocol 1: International armed conflict
            Protocol 2: Internal armed conflict

            US has never ratified, we consider them bining as customary intl law

                but we stop following them when it's inconvenient for us

            combat immunity: no prosecution for militarily justifiable warlike acts

        UN Charter Article 2

            peace first

            though un charter allows in appropriate moments to restore peace

            We're developing a two-tier system

                Russia, China, and US get one level of expectation
                Rest of the world held to a higher std

            Only the UN SC can legitimately authorize a war

            though any nation thats attacked can use force under art 51 inherent right of self defense

        Domestic Bases

            president cannot use force without authorization from congress

            Curtiss-Wright, Steel Seizure

            10th is the most important amendment from a power distribution standpoint

    International law is a consensual arrangement where states have agreed to be bound

        time + consent = law

    Key concepts:

        -protected person
        -protecting power
        -combatant immunity
        -grave breaches
        -UN Charter Art. 2, 24, 25, 51
        -relevant domestic law
            Constitution Art. I, II
            War Powers Resolution
            JCS Standing Rules of Engagement
            DoD Law of War Program

    Basic Principles from the Hague Rules

        -Military Necessity
        -Proportionality
        -Discrimination and distincition
        -Unnecessary suffering

        "The four corners of this course" -DC

    PURPOSES:

        -Humanitarianism

            Protecting both combatants and noncombatants from unnecessary suffering
            Safeguarding fundamental human rights of those captured
            Facilitating the restoration of peace

        -Functional Purpose

            Ensuring good order and discipline
            Fighting in a disciplined manner consistent with national values
            Maintinaing domestic and international support

    -Military Necessity

        This is the threshold inquiry.  If you're not good on this one, nothing else matters

        you can meet a spear, cellphone, and AK with any weapon system
        there is no fairness doctrine
            [you don't have any obligation to hobble your forces to match your enemy]

    -Proportionality

        the anticipated loss of life and damage to property incidental to attacks must not be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage to be gained

            Collateral Damage: unavoidable and unplanned damage to civilian personneland property while attacking a military objective.  Also called incidental damage.

    -Discrimination and distincition

        requires that combatants be dinstinguished from non-combatants, and that military objectives be dinstinguished from protected property or protected places

        Parties to a conflict can only direct their operations against combatants and military objectives

        the weapon system must be designed so that it can be aimed

            you have to hit what you're aiming at

        Though, we are not held to a higher standard of accuracy than the Sudanese Army, eg

        The sniper is the paradigmatic example of a distinct weapon system

            the B52 is not very discriminate, but still legal when targeting appropriately

    -Unnecessary suffering

        it is especially forbidden to employ arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering

        military personnel may not use arms that are per se calculated to cause unnecessary suffering , eg projectiles filled with glass, hollow point small caliber ammunition

            You can't use weapon systems that you lose control of after deployment

                gas is the classical example
                but think of autonomous weapon systems

        necessary suffering is taken as a given, and is permitted

            where the goal is to cause pain, and not to cause death or capture no go



    A belligerency:

        -organized force
        -controlling land
        -with a goal of overcoming the gov
        -

    TARGETING

        PERSONS

            combatants (regular armed forces in the traditional sense)

                responsible command
                distincitve emblem
                carry arms openly
                follow the laws of armed conflict
                enjoy battlefield immunity

            unlawful combatants

                no rights under the Geneva Convention
                    except Art 3
                also called unprivileged belligerents
                includes:
                    spies
                    saboteurs
                    civilians participating in the hostilities
                they are criminals on the battlefield
                they can be prosecuted, but must be treated humanely

            civilians

                no intentional targeting of civilians

                civilians who accompany the force

                    we give them a uniform
                    they can defend themselves

                    captured ones must be treated as POWs

            noncombatants

                (people who are allowed to move around the battlefield neutrally)

                out of combat:

                    prisoners of war

                    wounded, sick, and shipwrecked

                    parachutist with white/orange chutes (distinguished from paratrooper)

                medical personnel:

                    military

                    civilian

                military chaplins

                    we have 23 different faiths represented

        PLACES

            defended places- Subject to enemy attack.  warn only if civilians are present

            undefended places- no attacks

            natural environment- you can't detroy forests, eg

            protected areas- hospital zones, safety zones, cultural districts

            one page, double space, 12pt, std margins

            To: Dep Gen Counsel
            From: Daniel Viau
            Date:
            Subject: Russian Targeting of Syrian Hospital

            1.
            2.
            3.
            4.

    Post mortem:

    Should have established the existence of an armed conflict

        specifically, should have declared it was a NIAC

        should have analyzed the weapons systems use by the Russians

        there's a political argument that since the hospital was unmarked, it was not a protected place

    PROTECTED PLACES

        hospitals, undefended places, churches, places of cultural property

        hospitals should be marked, but the mark is not dispositive

        you can attack a hospital when it's been weaponized

            it loses its protected status

            the presence of a belligerent is not a license to kill civilians

            there's always self-defense as a last resort if there are soldiers pinned down

            you can also employ techniques like warning shots to clear the area

    Sub-Assignment:

        monitor the ICC trial against the Timbuktu Library destruction suspect

    Hague Rules on Targeting:

        distinguish
            lawful combatants
            unlawful combatants
            civilians

        when a lawful combatant is captured, he is a POW

        when an unlawful combatant is captured, he is a detainee
            to be prosecuted under the laws of the locality

        Hamdan v Rumsfeld

            first time SCOTUS used an international law as precedent

        civilians are protected

            civilians accompanying the force are treated as non-civilians
            theyre treated like lawful combatants

        noncombatants

            doctors, chaplins, and anyone assigned to a medical unit
            and
            those out of combat
                POWs
                wounded, sick, and shipwrecked
                parachutists

            medical personnel have a right to protect themselves and their patience

        PLACES

            you can attack a place of cultural value or a hospital if it has lost its protected status

            protected status is lost when a place is weaponized

        PROPERTY AND PROTECTED PLACES

            false use of protective emblems is a reason to ignore the protective emblem

            military objectives:

                military equpiment
                buildings
                factories
                transportation
                communications

            take care to analyze the collateral results of a given action

            PROTECTED PROPERTY:

                civilian property
                fixed and mobile hospitals
                medical transport
                cultural property
                    dedicated to the arts, sciences, religion, education, history, and charity
                objects indispensable to the survival of civilians
                works and installations containing dangerous forces
                    a chemical factory bomb aftermath could become a chlorine attack
                    a nuclear plant might create a meltdown

                usually protected, but can become targets if they're weaponized

            PROTECTIVE EMBLEMS

                MEDICAL EMBLEMS

                    now, it's only the red cross, the red diamond, and the red crescent

                    if it's not marked with one of the three emblems, it's not protected

                CULTURAL EMBLEM

                    blue and white down-pointing pentagon

                    it protects a cultural place

                        no attacking unless it becomes a weapon


    WEAPONS

        All weapons must be reviewed by the TJAG for legal suffiency

        THE TEST:

            Is a weapon or munitions' acquisition or use consistent witht he law of war and arms control treaties to which the US is a state party, or customary international law?

                [whether the employment of a weapon for its normal or expected use inevitably would cause injury or suffering manifestly disproportionate to its military effectiveness]

        ILLEGAL PER SE:

            barbed lances

            projectiles filled with glass

            improperly used weapons (notched FMJ rounds, eg)

            prohibited by treaty

            expanding bullets (dum dum bullets)

            hollow point bullets

            land mines (except in Korea, and except for self-neutralizing)

            booby traps

            poison and poisoned rounds

            chemical weapons

                riot control agents get special treatment

            biological weapons

        PRESUMPTIVELY LEGAL

            incendiaries

                napalm, flamethrowers, thermite, tracer, white phosphorous

                all lawful if used properly

            lasers

                lawful if not blinding

            nuclear weapons

                no customary or IL prohibition
                some treaties limit the use

        FIRST USE RENOUNCED

            herbicides

                no first use, except domestically and to control veg in defensive areas
                the medical fallout of agent orange made this a political problem

            chemical weapons used for riot control

    A lawful combatant

        wear insignia
        wear a uniform
            (these first two are no longer strict requirements)
        chain of command
        carry arms openly

    there's no conspiracy at the international level

        but aiding and abetting theory is available

        but right now we can't really directly hold accountable the corporations and nations

        command involvement theory might be available someday

    TACTICS

        Psychological Operations

            lawful
            used extensively in the cold war

            operation desert storm "the saddam leaflet"

                we promised to destroy a particular division
                then we did destroy them
                dropped leaflet promises
                lived up to them
                then they started surrendering

        Ruses and Deception

            injuring the enemy by legitimate deception
            deception lawful

                we faked a marine invasion off the kuwaiti coast

            fighting in enemy uniforms and flags is inadvisable [and perhaps illegal?]

                if they're caught by the enemy in an enemy uniform, no LOAC protections

                BUT:

                Article 39. – Emblems of nationality

                    2. It is prohibited to make use of the flags or military emblems, insignia or uniforms of adverse Parties while engaging in attacks or to shield, favour, protect or impede military operations.

        Treachery and Perfidy (feigning and misuse)

            perfidy involves injuring the enemy by his adherence of the law of war

                hiding behind a white flag
                using women and children as a shield
                feigning surrender or incapacitation
                misuse of the red cross
                feigning civilian status

        Assassination

            it's the politically motivated targeted killing of a person

            national policy prohibits assassination

            all prohibited:

                hiring assassins
                putting a price on a head
                offering rewards for dead or alive

            it's bad policy because it opens Pandora's box

        Espionage

            acting clandestinely to obtain info for transmission back to their side

            gathering intel in uniform is not espionage

            espionage is not a violation of LOAC

            no protection for spies under the GC's

            spies are tried under the laws of the capturing nation

        Reprisals

            conduct which would otherwise be unlawful
            resorted to by one belligerent
            against enemy personnel or property
            in response to a violation of LOAC
            for the purpose of enforcing future compliance

        RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

            commander's tool
            applying the LOAC to the mission

            directives issued by the officer that delineate the limitations
                for initiation and engagement with other forces

            ROE are drafted in consideration of
                LOAC
                national policy
                public opinion
                military operational constraints

            sometimes more restrictive than what's required by the LAOC

    WAR CRIMES

            grave breaches as defined in GC 1949
            violations of hague convention IV
            violations of common article 3

            General Yamashita was the first to be prosecuted under this theory

            the commander is personally directly liable for acts he knew of or shoulda

        investigative assests and reporting

            we have an obligation to report investigate and prosecute or else hand it over
