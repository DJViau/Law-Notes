    Treaty of Westphalia

    Robert Jackson

        prosecutor at Nuremberg

    Universal Declaration of Human Rights

        first legal declaration that people have a right to exist

        allows legal prosecution of murdering tyrants

    1949 was the big Geneva Convention

        -no targeting civilians
        -protect POWs
        -protect wounded and sick

    All 190 nations have signed the geneva conventions (only treaty with that claim)

    Hague Rules of 1907 tell who you can target and with what weapon systems

        military neccessity is the cornerstone of this analysis

    "War crimes are command failures" -DC

    What is a war crime?

        it's an act that results in a conviction of guilt at a fair trial

        it's a violation of an international legal standard

        committed by a combatant or [especially?] a leader

        against an unarmed person, a combatant after surrender, or a noncombatant

            killing the wrong person, or in the wrong way

        it's something [determined/discovered] by [due] process

            [and with a jury?]

        "soldiers have a duty to disobey unlawful orders"

            following orders is not an affirmative defense

        Nuremberg Trials: tribute by power to reason

        murder of unarmed unresisting civilians

        negligence on the part of commanders can mean guilt, but sometimes knowledge is required
