    liberal marginal notes are permitted in the statutory supplement for the final exam

    *go back and focus on the overview from the first assignment

    Themes:

        laws affecting the ability of non-us citizens to enter the US as immigrants or visitors

        the bases of removal of non us citizens from the US

        disparity of rights between citizens and non citizens

        exceptionalism of immigration law

    Substance:

        federal role in immigration, broad power of congress over regulation of immigration

            -fed over state
            -within fed gov, tensions between branches

        AG's delegation of power to INS, and the mixing of processing and enforcement

        the effect of 9/11 on restructuring

            USCIS now handles benefits
            ICE and CBP handle enforcement

        limited rights of non-citizens at the border

            for purposes of constitutional rights, the border (JFK) is not US territory

        DOJ still handles adjuticative stuff at EOIR, some suggest they shoudlnt

        DOS admits or denies viasa, oversees refugee program, weighs in on vocational stuff

        HHS handles refugee resettlement, and denies some immigrants on health grounds

            HHS also shelters kids from expedited removal

        The practical arguments for increasing the number of visas are winning over the moral reasons.  Tech sector wants to fight the brain drain.

        The diversity lottery is relatively small

            state dept website has quotas available

        History:

            1776-1875:  No restrictions.  We needed human capital.

            1875-1917:  Convicts and prostitutes barred.  Expanded to mentally ill, poor, and Chinese.

            1917-1924: First comprehensive statute. adds literacy test and numerical limits.  Quota law wasn't just about numbers.  facially nationality neutral, but gave preference to nationalities that already had a lot of people in the US.

                Opposition: The national quotas were about racism.

                    this is inconsistent with our constitutional values

                Support:  The national quotas were about facilitating assimilation.

                    it makes a more homogenous culture, and therefore prevents conflict

            1965 act abolished the quota system in an effort to end discrimination

                responds to the civil rights act

            1990 immigration act sets current ceiling

        Sources of Federal Immigration Power

            SCOTUS: congress has complete power about aliens.

                "over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete than it is over the admission, exclusion, and expulsion of aliens"

            they have plenary power over this area. judicial review is decidedly limited.

            the federalism argument for supremacy has morphed toward separation of powers

                congress is powerful over the states, sure
                but does this mean that congress can beat up on executive?

                    can executive protect undocumented by executive order?

            the constitution doesn't expressly give the power to congress

                that doesn't make what they've been doing unconstitutional

                it's unworkable to permit the states to handle immigration

            SOURCE ONE:  the commerce clause

                congress may regulate commerce with foreign nations

                but people aren't commerce

                but we've interpreted this to mean that congress has broad powers over anything substantially related to interstate commerce


Immigration Law Day 2
01/19/16

    Four enumerated powers provide Congress's Power to regulate immigration

        -The Commerce Clause
        -The Migration or Importation Clause
        -The Naturalization Clause
        -The War Clause

        Commerce:

            people affect commerce
            the commerce clause has been read broadly to allow congress to reg anything that substantially affects commerce

        Migration:

            gives congress power by implication
            history suggests its about slaves, though

        Naturalization:

            but immigration != naturalization
            admission and exclusion don't exactly fall neatly into naturalization
                however, with help from the N&P clause:

                if congress can say that only people who have x, y, and z characteristics can be naturalized, then they can deny access to those who don't have x, y, and z

                    but we often admit people who we never expect to be naturalized

        War:

            congress can exclude alien enemies while we're at war
            with n&p and war clause together, congress may admit alien friends

            you could argue for a peacetime power here:

                we can admit aliens in order to PREVENT war with a nation

    There's a limit to the enumerated sources of congressional power to reg immigration

    So scholars reach to imlied constitutional powers

        -what limits exist on the federal power to reg immigration?
        -to what extent do non-citizens enjoy rights under the U.S. Constitution?

    CHAE CHAN PING v US aka the CHINESE EXCLUSION CASE

        CONTEXT:

            written by a politically active judge who promoted anti-immigration legislation

            in the context of strong anti-chinese sentiment that grew from labor market realities

                Professor Kim frames the hate as growing from cultural differences as a lack of desire to assimilate

                there's also an invocation of national security in the debate

            "National Core" model of citizenship: we're a white protestant nation and newcomers should have to assimilate

        FACTS:

            Chinese laborer blocked from reentry by a law passed while he was sailing back

        ISSUES:

            Does the law violate the US's treaty obligations with China?

                no.

            Does the law violate the US Constitution?

                no.

                his certificate was a a revocable licesne granted by congress.

                his lawyered argued that congress didn't have the enumerated power under the constitution to deny him entry

                    it should be left to the states under the tenth

                the court responds:

                    the power over immigration is an inherent sovereign power

                    three theories of implied delegation:

                        -general foreign affairs power
                        -structural theories
                        -obviousness theory

                        even if we accept a general foreign affairs power, it's not clear that immigration falls into that zone

        HOLDING:

            (1) congress has the power to exclude non citizens because it is inherent in what it means to be a sovereign state

            (2) the decision by congress to exclude Mr Ping is conclusive on the judiciary

                in other words, courts can't review a federal statute about immigration
                another way, it's constitutional because congress said so

                THIS IS INCONSISTENT with judicial review from marbury v madison

                    it gives too much power to one branch (leg)

                Should a person who has connections to the country have a bigger bundle of constitutional rights?

                SCOTUS cited this case in 2002, 10th circuit cited it in 2004

                extent of congressional power and ability of courts to review^

    LIMITS TO THE FEDERAL IMMIGRATION POWER?

        are there any?
        can the court declare the limits?

        EKIU v US

            ISSUE:  Does a lack of judicial review of an administratitive denial of admission violate Ekiu's due process rights?

                contrast to ping, who says, "you don't have the power"
                here, ekiu says, "you have the power, but you didn't do it right"

                ping argues about the existence or non existence of a power
                ekiu argues about the proper handling of an admitted power

                is the HOLDING 1 or 2?

                    1- Ekiu enjoys due process rights, but Congress did not violate them by entrusting the fact finding exclusively to administrative officials

                        this version of the holding would suggest that the court had some review

                    2- Congress alone decides to what extent constitutional due process rights exist at all in exclusion cases

                        in this version, the court has no capacity for review

                    It's 2:

                        god doesn't say it because it's right, it's right because god declares it to be so

                        here, congress is god

        FONG YUE TING

            [third leg of the congressional plenary power stool.]

            Congress passes a law requiring a certificate of residence for all chinese residents in the US, unless the chinese person could find a credibel white witness to testify to his residency.

            Chinese laborer gets arrested w/o a CR, and that makes them deportable

            The court finds that the gov can deport noncitizens with the same authority that they can exclude noncitizens

                because:

                    -political question
                    -incident of sovreignty

            This is factually distinguishable from the two prior cases in that these Chinese laborers had been in the US for a while.

                the difference is between exclusion and deportation

                    [now, everything is called a removal, but they retain the distinction]

            ISSUE: can congress req the testimony of a white witness to avoid deportation?

            HOLDING: Due process applies and congress, not the court, decides what process is due, but the white witness rule satisfied due process

            BREWER DISSENT:

                Residents who are domiciled in the US have more rights than newcomers under international law.
                The 14th protects persons, not citizens.  It applies territorially.
                The process given by the exec is not enough to pass constitutional muster for him.
                People subject to deportation proceedings should get a bigger bundle of rights because they have greater ties.
                    [though this bit about ties is not always]

            FIELD DISSENT:

                Active in CA anti-immigration, author of chinese exclusion case majority

                he dissents here bc

                    8thA deportation is cruel and unusual
                    4thA deportation is an unreasonable seizure

            Deportation and Foreign Affairs:

                what's the relationship betweeen deportation and FA?
                is it stronger than the rel between exclusion and FA?

                    weaker bc

                        exclusion affects more [Chinese nationals]
                        deportation is individualized

                        deportation affects a person who has become "part american"
                        exclusion affects a person who is still almost totally [Chinese]

            Based on the maj's rationale, it seems that there's only extremely limited space for review by the court.  p 121-122.  they're extremely deferential.

                Now we've created statutory rights to due process that would prevent this kind of crap.

            Is deportation punishment for which 8th amendments should apply?

                the goals of deportation align with the goals of punishment
                    it serves retributive and deterrent ends

                therefore it is punishment, but the maj refuses this analysis

        TEST FOR DUE PROCESS ANALYSIS:

            -is the due process clause implicated?

                -is there a state action?
                -is there individual decisionmaking?
                -is there deprivation of life LIBERTY property?

            -if so, what process is due?

                maj says:  whatever the fuck the executive gave you

                modern test: matthew's v eldridge

                    -private interest to be affected
                    -risk of erroneous deprivation
                    -probable value of additional or substitute procedural safeguards
                    -the gov's interest, including the function involved and the burdens that extra process would put on the gov

                    if we applied this test to fong yue ting, things would come out differently

            These first three cases are still used sometimes to show congress's plenary immigration power

            Ways to reject dp challenges in exclusion cases:

                1- procedural due process is not owed to this class of persons
                2- pro dp is owed, but whatever the political branches decide is enough

    KNAUFF v SHAUGHNESSY

        whatever is authorized by congress IS dp as far as an alien denied entry is concerned.

        it seems the court might not even have the power to review

    SHAUGHNESSY v US EX REL MEZEI aka

    MEZEI

        guy stranded on Ellis Island case

        FACTS:  foreign-born dude lives in US for years, leaves to visit his dying mom, and attempts to return on a visa

        all he's asking for is a hearing to figure out why he's being excluded

        ISSUE:  whether his detention and exclusion without an evidentiary hearing constitutes a denial of due process

        they say no DP violation, and cite all the usual garbage about sov power

        the maj says the issue is largely immune from judicial review

            why does the maj hold so brutally?

                -he went "behind the iron curtain"
                -he was gone for 19 months

            ENTRY FICTION: we use this legal fiction to claim that people entering the US are not in the territory of the US until they're "through the gates."  Ellis Island or JFK are not considered US territory in this sense.

        more deference to congress

        you'd argue to limit this holding by emphasizing the national security aspect of this fact pattern

            this limits the discretion of the political branches

        DISSENT:

            he was detained indefinitely!

                otherwise, he'd probably side with the maj

    I'M ON CALL FOR YAMATAYA!
