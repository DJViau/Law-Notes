            -within fed gov, tensions between branches

        AG's delegation of power to INS, and the mixing of processing and enforcement

            USCIS now handles benefits
            ICE and CBP handle enforcement

        limited rights of non-citizens at the border

            for purposes of constitutional rights, the border (JFK) is not US territory

        DOJ still handles adjuticative stuff at EOIR, some suggest they shoudlnt

        DOS admits or denies viasa, oversees refugee program, weighs in on vocational stuff

        History:

            1776-1875:  No restrictions.  We needed human capital.

            1875-1917:  Convicts and prostitutes barred.  Expanded to mentally ill, poor, and Chinese.

            1917-1924: First comprehensive statute. adds literacy test and numerical limits.  Quota law wasn't just about numbers.  facially nationality neutral, but gave preference to nationalities that already had a lot of people in the US.

                Opposition: The national quotas were about racism.

                    this is inconsistent with our constitutional values

                Support:  The national quotas were about facilitating assimilation.

                    it makes a more homogenous culture, and therefore prevents conflict

            1965 act abolished the quota system in an effort to end discrimination

                responds to the civil rights act

            1990 immigration act sets current ceiling

        Sources of Federal Immigration Power

            SCOTUS: congress has complete power about aliens.

                "over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete than it is over the admission, exclusion, and expulsion of aliens"

            they have plenary power over this area. judicial review is decidedly limited.

            the federalism argument for supremacy has morphed toward separation of powers

                congress is powerful over the states, sure
                but does this mean that congress can beat up on executive?

                    can executive protect undocumented by executive order?

            the constitution doesn't expressly give the power to congress

                that doesn't make what they've been doing unconstitutional

                it's unworkable to permit the states to handle immigration

            SOURCE ONE:  the commerce clause

                congress may regulate commerce with foreign nations

                but people aren't commerce

                but we've interpreted this to mean that congress has broad powers over anything substantially related to interstate commerce
