Comparative Law Day 1
01/14/16

    Themes:

        General difference between common and civil law traditions
        Specific Civil Procedure differences between common and civil law

    Some History:

        Codification in US started in late 1800s
        NY developed codified civ pro (field code 1850)
            [fact pleading = code pleading]
            [UCC grows from German Law]

        Commonwealth 1949 voluntary org of soverign nations, about 53

            www.thecommonwealth.org

            they had 1/4 of the world at one point, and 1/5 of population, largest

            they use common law

        THE REST OF THE WORLD

                adopts the civil law approach because of Romans and French
                most widely adopted in the world

                Civil Law goes by "Romanic Germanic Tradition" when they refer to themselves

            Countries of mixed jdx:

                Louisiana, Quebec, Scotland, Israel, South Africa

            Communist legal tradition is basically civil law with a layer of communist ideology

            Sharia Tradition

                not incompatible with Common or Civil law systems

                is incompatible with Western Values

                often reserved for family law and inheritance law, and civil code provides the rest

                Saudi Arabia and Oman use exclusively Sharia, it operates like a constitution

                some countries operate one school for law and one school for sharia, some offer an integrated education and issue both degrees

    Main differences between common and civil law traditions

        common law is based on precedent, civil law is based on codes

        common law decision flow downward in the heirarchy

            internal coherence is not sought
            consistency is not an aim, especially across jdx

            unless you have a decision from the supreme court, you're in the dark

            the law is rarely written, and it's in insanely broad language (reasonable person, foreseeable)

            lots of room for discretion

            we're moving toward codification

            laws get enacted in the wake of a decision

        civil law is about a search for coherent general principles

            precedents are not binding, only the law
            it's more predictable, but less flexible

Comparative Law Day 2
01/19/16

    The civil law countries (germany vs latin america) see each other as disparate until they frame it in terms of common law vs civil law

    We learn comparative law to better understand ourselves.

        "You can only know yourself in comparison" -AG

    It also gives us conceptual resources to improve our own system.

    What is globalization?

        free flow of goods, services, money, and people

        the world acts like a big market

        rules now emanate from regional agreements and multinational companies

        in many cases, it means Americanization, but less so recently

    The study of comparative law here largely grew from the influx of jewish-german refugees in the middle of the 20th century

        today, comparative law is mostly still taught by foreign professors

    Postive Law:  Law that was enacted

        contrast to Natural Law:  exists independently, law of reason


Comparative Law Day 3
01/21/16

    conflict of laws:  deciding which law to apply

        in US:  which state law to apply?
        elsewhere:  which country's law to apply?

        6 states might have jdx over a conflict, but which of those laws to apply is a different issue

        this can be a hurdle, or it can be a forum shopping tool

            you might sue someone in CA so that they apply the laws of NJ

    international law:

        public int law
            relationship between countries
        private int law
            for commerce, tort, etc

    international litigation:

        happens in a domestic court, has interntional element

            eg american company invests in a german company, and sues in GER

            or a FR judgment that needs to be enforced here

            any litigation with  discovery or service of process abroad

    history of comparative law:

        goes as far back as Plato

    Civ Pro:

        in other countries, two different courts perform the role of the SCOTUS

            deciding the top level appeals of the federal system on existing law
            and
            deciding on constitutional issues

        "How are baby judges born?" -GIDI

            US federal: judges are appointed for life by the President based on political contacts and ideology

                if you want to be a judge, you need a senator

                the parties want smart and sophisticated minds to convince their peers

            US state:  judges are elected, they neeed connections and end up owing favors

            ENG:  judges are selected for their quality among a very small number of barristers

                they all know each other, and it's judges doing the choosing
                barristers are already a select group, and judges pick new judges based on quality

            PALESTINE: selected by the chief judge, approved by the president

            SAUDI ARABIA:  selected from people with clean records and extensive study of sharia

            CIVIL:  it's a public service career.  they're not politicians, they're technicians.  it's a prestigious bureaucratic position.  less power than CL judges.

                selection:  you pass a public exam immediately after law school, it's like the bar exam [3 days of MC, then 3 days drafting/essay, then oral exam].  candidates are ranked and then employed based on where they fall in the rankings

                once you're a judge, you're a judge for life

                    most legal positions such as prosecutor, etc are fileld this way

                there's an age limitation typically (22, 25, 30) and an experience req

                    sometimes there's a cap, too (no one over 40)

                passing the exam is only half way, some countries have judge school

Comparative Law Day 5
02/2/16

    Civil Law heirarchy

        the need for specialized judges is important in the civil law tradition because of the inquisitorial tradition

        in GER, the federal constitutional court is not part of the rest of the heirarchy

        in civil law tradition, second instance courts review both facts and law

        everyone has 3-judge panels in the courts of appeals

        in common law bench trials: you cannot appeal issues of fact

            the first instance judge got to see the witness and assess credibility
            but it locks in anything that's incorrect

            deference given in fact, deference given in discretionary matters
            no deference given in review of law

        in civil law tradition, no deference given to ct of first instance regarding issues of fact

        in common law countries other than US, the distinction is between oral evidence and other types of evidence

            issues of credibility are left to the trial court
            issues around documentary evidence and inferences are reviewable

                US had this until 1985

                not super plaintiff-friendly, but perhaps a little bit so

        the myth of credibility of evidence allows the trier of fact to import bias

            in the civil law tradition, they don't give much weight to that myth

                as a result, they're very bound by documents

                witness testimony is considered the least credible

                here, the trial is more oral and testimony has more weight

            even when they're giving innocent testimony, they're only about 65% good

            in FR, everything is through affidavit

        Civil law appeals are of fact and law partly because civil law judges are young bureaucrats

            it's about quality control to some extent

        RULES of evidence

            in a common law adversarial system

                they exist to prevent the jury from making stupid decisions
                it protects the jury from going wild with bias

                    if it's not probative and too sensational, they'll crucify the defendant to make at least someone pay

            in a civil law inquisitorial system

                we trust a judge to make a more sensible assessment
                he's a professional, knows how to discount hearsay
                it helps him to puzzle it out, but won't go wild

Comparative Law Day 6
02/4/16

    COMMON LAW

        lots of conflicts don't become cases, lots don't make it to judgment, lots don't appeal, lots don't get reversed

        courts of appeal actively discourage appeals

        unhealthy limited appeal

    CIVIL LAW

        most cases go to full judgement, and then are appealed

        unhealthy excessive appeal

    SUPREME COURTS

        this means the court of last resort of legal matters, not for constitutional matters

            the consitutional court is a different animal altogether

            there's also a supreme administrative court in FR tradition (conseil d'etat)

        in countries with a french influence, they're called courts of cassation

            in US, it's discretionary, in these countries, you have a right to appeal

                as a result SCOTUS only does 80-100 cases per year
                    all of them heard en banc (all 9)
                many more are heard in civil law countries
                    maybe 20k or 100k per year
                    but they have hundreds of judges
                    cases are heard in panels of 3-7

        the objective of the supreme court in any country is to provide uniform intepretation of the law

            without precedential effect, the civil law court must decide many many more cases

        the revision model allow a supreme court to render a judment on the case

        the court of cassation breaks the decision and sends it back down

            it remands, it can't substitute its own judgment

            the lower courts (cts of appeals) is not bound, so they send the case to a ct of appeals in a neighboring city

            if the second ct of appeals still doesn't follow the ct of cassation,
            the party appeals again to the assemblaire pleniaire,
            and then it goes back down to a third ct of appeals,
            who is bound by the decision of the assemblaire pleniaire

            this goes back to the french revolution, which distrusted the judiciary

        in most countries with a court of cassation, they allow cassation without remand


Comparative Law Day 7
02/9/16

    Supreme Courts continued

    Gov issues an amicus brief on each conflict that goes to the supreme court

        it's not argumentative, it's not political. it's just about interpretation.

        [outside the US, courts are not used much for social reform]

    After the judgment is binding, and the case is over, the gov might file an appeal

        its objective is to let the correct interpretation stand, its a platonic appeal

        no effect on parties, just about elucidating the best interpretation

    In the US, the solicitor general represents the interests of the gov, but they have a reputation for candor and neutrality

        typically a straight shooter, but more political than its European counterparts

        when the US is not a party, the solicitor general can chime in

        the court can ask whether to grant cert

        and he can chime in on the merits too

        they went from acting in 1/3 of cases in the 80s, to 2/3 recently

        SG can speak at oral arguments, almost no other amicus can

        AG == minister of justice
        SG == lawyer for gov

        in almost all cases of SG participation, federal interests are involved

        former SGs: KAGAN, ROBERTS, JACKSON, TAFT

    SUPREME COURTS ABOVE

    CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS BELOW

        we're talking about judicial review here

    three aspects to judicial review:

        -control by judiciary of the judiciary (done through appeal)
        -control by judiciary of the constitutionality of legislative acts
        -control by judiciary over the legality of actions of the executive

    the civil law tradition doesn't like the idea of the judiciary tampering with legislative acts

        this distrust grew from the french revolutionary era, where judges were instruments of the old regime

        they're not elected in most countries

        they're obligated to apply the law mechanically

    From a separation of powers standpoint, judicial review makes no sense --GIDI

        "The judicial control cannot stop Hitler."  --GIDI

    Two models of judicial review:

        -diffuse control

            any judge can refuse to apply a law they believe violates the constitution
            [the least democratic of the three branches make the call]
            SCTOUS does not have a de jure monopoly on judicial review

        -concentrated control

            judges at all instances must apply all norms even if they're unconstitutional
            if a party wants to challenge the constitutionality of a statute, they have to take it to the constitutional court outside of the ordinary court system

            German model

                outside of judiciary structure
                political body

                Three ways for an issue to reach the German const ct:

                    -in abstract on motion of a political body or political leader.
                        no case or controversy.  the law itself is analyzed in abstract.
                    -judicial referral
                        quintessential European mode
                        lower ct cannot invalidate a statute, cannot decide not to apply
                        the ct must apply the statute or
                        the court may stay the proceeding and
                        refer the issue of constitutionality to the const court
                        the party has no right to appeal to const ct
                        the ct itself sends the issue up and over to the const ct
                    -

            French model
