Comparative Law Day 1
01/14/16

    Themes:

        General difference between common and civil law traditions
        Specific Civil Procedure differences between common and civil law

    Some History:

        Codification in US started in late 1800s
        NY developed codified civ pro (field code 1850)
            [fact pleading = code pleading]
            [UCC grows from German Law]

        Commonwealth 1949 voluntary org of soverign nations, about 53

            www.thecommonwealth.org

            they had 1/4 of the world at one point, and 1/5 of population, largest

            they use common law

        THE REST OF THE WORLD

                adopts the civil law approach because of Romans and French
                most widely adopted in the world

                Civil Law goes by "Romanic Germanic Tradition" when they refer to themselves

            Countries of mixed jdx:

                Louisiana, Quebec, Scotland, Israel, South Africa

            Communist legal tradition is basically civil law with a layer of communist ideology

            Sharia Tradition

                not incompatible with Common or Civil law systems

                is incompatible with Western Values

                often reserved for family law and inheritance law, and civil code provides the rest

                Saudi Arabia and Oman use exclusively Sharia, it operates like a constitution

                some countries operate one school for law and one school for sharia, some offer an integrated education and issue both degrees

    Main differences between common and civil law traditions

        common law is based on precedent, civil law is based on codes

        common law decision flow downward in the heirarchy

            internal coherence is not sought
            consistency is not an aim, especially across jdx

            unless you have a decision from the supreme court, you're in the dark

            the law is rarely written, and it's in insanely broad language (reasonable person, foreseeable)

            lots of room for discretion

            we're moving toward codification

            laws get enacted in the wake of a decision

        civil law is about a search for coherent general principles

            precedents are not binding, only the law
            it's more predictable, but less flexible

Comparative Law Day 2
01/19/16

    The civil law countries (germany vs latin america) see each other as disparate until they frame it in terms of common law vs civil law

    We learn comparative law to better understand ourselves.

        "You can only know yourself in comparison" -AG

    It also gives us conceptual resources to improve our own system.

    What is globalization?

        free flow of goods, services, money, and people

        the world acts like a big market

        rules now emanate from regional agreements and multinational companies

        in many cases, it means Americanization, but less so recently

    The study of comparative law here largely grew from the influx of jewish-german refugees in the middle of the 20th century

        today, comparative law is mostly still taught by foreign professors

    Postive Law:  Law that was enacted

        contrast to Natural Law:  exists independently, law of reason


Comparative Law Day 3
01/21/16

    conflict of laws:  deciding which law to apply

        in US:  which state law to apply?
        elsewhere:  which country's law to apply?

        6 states might have jdx over a conflict, but which of those laws to apply is a different issue

        this can be a hurdle, or it can be a forum shopping tool

            you might sue someone in CA so that they apply the laws of NJ

    international law:

        public int law
            relationship between countries
        private int law
            for commerce, tort, etc

    international litigation:

        happens in a domestic court, has interntional element

            eg american company invests in a german company, and sues in GER

            or a FR judgment that needs to be enforced here

            any litigation with  discovery or service of process abroad

    history of comparative law:

        goes as far back as Plato

    Civ Pro:

        in other countries, two different courts perform the role of the SCOTUS

            deciding the top level appeals of the federal system on existing law
            and
            deciding on constitutional issues

        "How are baby judges born?" -GIDI

            US federal: judges are appointed for life by the President based on political contacts and ideology

                if you want to be a judge, you need a senator

                the parties want smart and sophisticated minds to convince their peers

            US state:  judges are elected, they neeed connections and end up owing favors

            ENG:  judges are selected for their quality among a very small number of barristers

                they all know each other, and it's judges doing the choosing
                barristers are already a select group, and judges pick new judges based on quality

            PALESTINE: selected by the chief judge, approved by the president

            SAUDI ARABIA:  selected from people with clean records and extensive study of sharia

            CIVIL:  it's a public service career.  they're not politicians, they're technicians.  it's a prestigious bureaucratic position.  less power than CL judges.

                selection:  you pass a public exam immediately after law school, it's like the bar exam [3 days of MC, then 3 days drafting/essay, then oral exam].  candidates are ranked and then employed based on where they fall in the rankings

                once you're a judge, you're a judge for life

                    most legal positions such as prosecutor, etc are fileld this way

                there's an age limitation typically (22, 25, 30) and an experience req

                    sometimes there's a cap, too (no one over 40)

                passing the exam is only half way, some countries have judge school
