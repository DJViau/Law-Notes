    Some History:

        Codification in US started in late 1800s
        NY developed codified civ pro (field code 1850)
            [fact pleading = code pleading]
            [UCC grows from German Law]

        Commonwealth 1949 voluntary org of soverign nations, about 53

            they had 1/4 of the world at one point, and 1/5 of population, largest

            they use common law

        THE REST OF THE WORLD

                adopts the civil law approach because of Romans and French
                most widely adopted in the world

                Civil Law goes by "Romanic Germanic Tradition" when they refer to themselves

            Countries of mixed jdx:

                Louisiana, Quebec, Scotland, Israel, South Africa

            Communist legal tradition is basically civil law with a layer of communist ideology

            Sharia Tradition

                not incompatible with Common or Civil law systems

                is incompatible with Western Values

                often reserved for family law and inheritance law, and civil code provides the rest

                Saudi Arabia and Oman use exclusively Sharia, it operates like a constitution

                some countries operate one school for law and one school for sharia, some offer an integrated education and issue both degrees

    Main differences between common and civil law traditions

        common law is based on precedent, civil law is based on codes

        common law decision flow downward in the heirarchy

            internal coherence is not sought
            consistency is not an aim, especially across jdx

            unless you have a decision from the supreme court, you're in the dark

            the law is rarely written, and it's in insanely broad language (reasonable person, foreseeable)

            lots of room for discretion

            we're moving toward codification

            laws get enacted in the wake of a decision

        civil law is about a search for coherent general principles

            precedents are not binding, only the law
            it's more predictable, but less flexible
