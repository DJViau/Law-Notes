Comparative Law Day 1
01/14/16

    Themes:

        General difference between common and civil law traditions
        Specific Civil Procedure differences between common and civil law

    Some History:

        Codification in US started in late 1800s
        NY developed codified civ pro (field code 1850)
            [fact pleading = code pleading]
            [UCC grows from German Law]

        Commonwealth 1949 voluntary org of soverign nations, about 53

            www.thecommonwealth.org

            they had 1/4 of the world at one point, and 1/5 of population, largest

            they use common law

        THE REST OF THE WORLD

                adopts the civil law approach because of Romans and French
                most widely adopted in the world

                Civil Law goes by "Romanic Germanic Tradition" when they refer to themselves

            Countries of mixed jdx:

                Louisiana, Quebec, Scotland, Israel, South Africa

            Communist legal tradition is basically civil law with a layer of communist ideology

            Sharia Tradition

                not incompatible with Common or Civil law systems

                is incompatible with Western Values

                often reserved for family law and inheritance law, and civil code provides the rest

                Saudi Arabia and Oman use exclusively Sharia, it operates like a constitution

                some countries operate one school for law and one school for sharia, some offer an integrated education and issue both degrees

    Main differences between common and civil law traditions

        common law is based on precedent, civil law is based on codes

        common law decision flow downward in the heirarchy

            internal coherence is not sought
            consistency is not an aim, especially across jdx

            unless you have a decision from the supreme court, you're in the dark

            the law is rarely written, and it's in insanely broad language (reasonable person, foreseeable)

            lots of room for discretion

            we're moving toward codification

            laws get enacted in the wake of a decision

        civil law is about a search for coherent general principles

            precedents are not binding, only the law
            it's more predictable, but less flexible

Comparative Law Day 2
01/19/16

    The civil law countries (germany vs latin america) see each other as disparate until they frame it in terms of common law vs civil law

    We learn comparative law to better understand ourselves.

        "You can only know yourself in comparison" -AG

    It also gives us conceptual resources to improve our own system.

    What is globalization?

        free flow of goods, services, money, and people

        the world acts like a big market

        rules now emanate from regional agreements and multinational companies

        in many cases, it means Americanization, but less so recently

    The study of comparative law here largely grew from the influx of jewish-german refugees in the middle of the 20th century

        today, comparative law is mostly still taught by foreign professors

    Postive Law:  Law that was enacted

        contrast to Natural Law:  exists independently, law of reason


Comparative Law Day 3
01/21/16

    conflict of laws:  deciding which law to apply

        in US:  which state law to apply?
        elsewhere:  which country's law to apply?

        6 states might have jdx over a conflict, but which of those laws to apply is a different issue

        this can be a hurdle, or it can be a forum shopping tool

            you might sue someone in CA so that they apply the laws of NJ

    international law:

        public int law
            relationship between countries
        private int law
            for commerce, tort, etc

    international litigation:

        happens in a domestic court, has interntional element

            eg american company invests in a german company, and sues in GER

            or a FR judgment that needs to be enforced here

            any litigation with  discovery or service of process abroad

    history of comparative law:

        goes as far back as Plato

    Civ Pro:

        in other countries, two different courts perform the role of the SCOTUS

            deciding the top level appeals of the federal system on existing law
            and
            deciding on constitutional issues

        "How are baby judges born?" -GIDI

            US federal: judges are appointed for life by the President based on political contacts and ideology

                if you want to be a judge, you need a senator

                the parties want smart and sophisticated minds to convince their peers

            US state:  judges are elected, they neeed connections and end up owing favors

            ENG:  judges are selected for their quality among a very small number of barristers

                they all know each other, and it's judges doing the choosing
                barristers are already a select group, and judges pick new judges based on quality

            PALESTINE: selected by the chief judge, approved by the president

            SAUDI ARABIA:  selected from people with clean records and extensive study of sharia

            CIVIL:  it's a public service career.  they're not politicians, they're technicians.  it's a prestigious bureaucratic position.  less power than CL judges.

                selection:  you pass a public exam immediately after law school, it's like the bar exam [3 days of MC, then 3 days drafting/essay, then oral exam].  candidates are ranked and then employed based on where they fall in the rankings

                once you're a judge, you're a judge for life

                    most legal positions such as prosecutor, etc are fileld this way

                there's an age limitation typically (22, 25, 30) and an experience req

                    sometimes there's a cap, too (no one over 40)

                passing the exam is only half way, some countries have judge school

Comparative Law Day 5
02/2/16

    Civil Law heirarchy

        the need for specialized judges is important in the civil law tradition because of the inquisitorial tradition

        in GER, the federal constitutional court is not part of the rest of the heirarchy

        in civil law tradition, second instance courts review both facts and law

        everyone has 3-judge panels in the courts of appeals

        in common law bench trials: you cannot appeal issues of fact

            the first instance judge got to see the witness and assess credibility
            but it locks in anything that's incorrect

            deference given in fact, deference given in discretionary matters
            no deference given in review of law

        in civil law tradition, no deference given to ct of first instance regarding issues of fact

        in common law countries other than US, the distinction is between oral evidence and other types of evidence

            issues of credibility are left to the trial court
            issues around documentary evidence and inferences are reviewable

                US had this until 1985

                not super plaintiff-friendly, but perhaps a little bit so

        the myth of credibility of evidence allows the trier of fact to import bias

            in the civil law tradition, they don't give much weight to that myth

                as a result, they're very bound by documents

                witness testimony is considered the least credible

                here, the trial is more oral and testimony has more weight

            even when they're giving innocent testimony, they're only about 65% good

            in FR, everything is through affidavit

        Civil law appeals are of fact and law partly because civil law judges are young bureaucrats

            it's about quality control to some extent

        RULES of evidence

            in a common law adversarial system

                they exist to prevent the jury from making stupid decisions
                it protects the jury from going wild with bias

                    if it's not probative and too sensational, they'll crucify the defendant to make at least someone pay

            in a civil law inquisitorial system

                we trust a judge to make a more sensible assessment
                he's a professional, knows how to discount hearsay
                it helps him to puzzle it out, but won't go wild

Comparative Law Day 6
02/4/16

    COMMON LAW

        lots of conflicts don't become cases, lots don't make it to judgment, lots don't appeal, lots don't get reversed

        courts of appeal actively discourage appeals

        unhealthy limited appeal

    CIVIL LAW

        most cases go to full judgement, and then are appealed

        unhealthy excessive appeal

    SUPREME COURTS

        this means the court of last resort of legal matters, not for constitutional matters

            the consitutional court is a different animal altogether

            there's also a supreme administrative court in FR tradition (conseil d'etat)

        in countries with a french influence, they're called courts of cassation

            in US, it's discretionary, in these countries, you have a right to appeal

                as a result SCOTUS only does 80-100 cases per year
                    all of them heard en banc (all 9)
                many more are heard in civil law countries
                    maybe 20k or 100k per year
                    but they have hundreds of judges
                    cases are heard in panels of 3-7

        the objective of the supreme court in any country is to provide uniform intepretation of the law

            without precedential effect, the civil law court must decide many many more cases

        the revision model allow a supreme court to render a judment on the case

        the court of cassation breaks the decision and sends it back down

            it remands, it can't substitute its own judgment

            the lower courts (cts of appeals) is not bound, so they send the case to a ct of appeals in a neighboring city

            if the second ct of appeals still doesn't follow the ct of cassation,
            the party appeals again to the assemblaire pleniaire,
            and then it goes back down to a third ct of appeals,
            who is bound by the decision of the assemblaire pleniaire

            this goes back to the french revolution, which distrusted the judiciary

        in most countries with a court of cassation, they allow cassation without remand


Comparative Law Day 7
02/9/16

    Supreme Courts continued

    Gov issues an amicus brief on each conflict that goes to the supreme court

        it's not argumentative, it's not political. it's just about interpretation.

        [outside the US, courts are not used much for social reform]

    After the judgment is binding, and the case is over, the gov might file an appeal

        its objective is to let the correct interpretation stand, its a platonic appeal

        no effect on parties, just about elucidating the best interpretation

    In the US, the solicitor general represents the interests of the gov, but they have a reputation for candor and neutrality

        typically a straight shooter, but more political than its European counterparts

        when the US is not a party, the solicitor general can chime in

        the court can ask whether to grant cert

        and he can chime in on the merits too

        they went from acting in 1/3 of cases in the 80s, to 2/3 recently

        SG can speak at oral arguments, almost no other amicus can

        AG == minister of justice
        SG == lawyer for gov

        in almost all cases of SG participation, federal interests are involved

        former SGs: KAGAN, ROBERTS, JACKSON, TAFT

    SUPREME COURTS ABOVE

    CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS BELOW

        SPECIAL PRESENTATION ON THE SPANISH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT

            operates much like the GER system
            judges must apply the law, but they can send it up to the const ct
            they can interpret the constitutional issues, if there is no doctrine
            the const ct can reject an unconstitutional law directly
            if someone challenges 10 articles of a law, the court can void 20
            overwhelmed by number of "Amparo" appeals, legislation made it more strict
            after an amparo appeal, the const ct can auto-cuestion de inconstitutionalidad
            they dont award damages, they just remand
            they have dissenting opinions
            judges have 9 year term limits
            referral from courts below, direct action by politicians, and recurso de amparo


        we're talking about judicial review here

    three aspects to judicial review:

        -control by judiciary of the judiciary (done through appeal)
        -control by judiciary of the constitutionality of legislative acts
        -control by judiciary over the legality of actions of the executive

    the civil law tradition doesn't like the idea of the judiciary tampering with legislative acts

        this distrust grew from the french revolutionary era, where judges were instruments of the old regime

        they're not elected in most countries

        they're obligated to apply the law mechanically

    From a separation of powers standpoint, judicial review makes no sense --GIDI

        "The judicial control cannot stop Hitler."  --GIDI

    Two models of judicial review:

        -diffuse control

            any judge can refuse to apply a law they believe violates the constitution
            [the least democratic of the three branches make the call]
            SCTOUS does not have a de jure monopoly on judicial review

        -concentrated control

            judges at all instances must apply all norms even if they're unconstitutional
            if a party wants to challenge the constitutionality of a statute, they have to take it to the constitutional court outside of the ordinary court system

        German model

            outside of judiciary structure
            political body
            16 members, all appointed
                6 are former judges from top cts
                10 are lawyers, professors
                12 year terms
            they can sit in different sized panels (3,8)

            Three ways for an issue to reach the German const ct:

                -DIRECT ACTION
                    in abstract on motion of a political body or political leader.
                    no case or controversy.  the law itself is analyzed in abstract.
                    most complicated bc standing requires a political figure
                -JUDICIAL REFERRAL
                    quintessential European mode
                    considered default method in Europe
                    lower ct cannot invalidate a statute, cannot decide not to apply
                    the ct must apply the statute or
                    the court may stay the proceeding and
                    refer the issue of constitutionality to the const court
                    the party has no right to appeal to const ct
                    the ct itself sends the issue up and over to the const ct
                -CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLAINT
                    anyone who feels that some action has violated their constitutional rights may bring this
                    you have to exhaust all judicial remedies first
                    only needed if you couldn't convince a lower ct to refer to const ct
                    works for any judicial, admin, or legislative act
                    very popular

        French model

            Traditionally:

                no judicial review.  Once enacted, it was constitutional.
                No court could speak on its constitutionality
                even the supreme ct could not weigh in
                even the constitutional court could not say anything

                from the French revolution until 1958 (almost 200 years)

            1958:

                enacted a constitution that created the constitutional counsel
                but the constitutionality could only be challenged before it was enacted
                and only by political figures
                furthermore, president has no veto power

            2008:

                major amendment to the constitution that created a REAL constitutional ct
                with real judicial review

            2010:

                statute furthers

            The French now use judicial referral

                but only cour de cassation and the conseil detat may refer to the const ct

                but not all violations of the const go to the const ct

                    only available if the party claims the legislative act violates his constitutional right or freedom

            If the const council declares it unconstitutional

                it has binding effect
                and it takes the law out of the system
                and it can no longer be applied

            It's openly considered a political court with political appointments

                and there are term limits
                there are 9 members, who serve 9 year terms, nonrenewable
                former presidents are life members of the const council
                its also outside the judicial heirarchy, separate

        Most Latin American countries adopted constitutional courts

            some combine supreme and const duties
            some have separate supreme and const courts

            they enjoy dual influence from Europe and US

                different levels and different times sway the influence

                judicial structure is European
                    German code is basis
                constitutional structure is American
                    Brazil, for example

            Brazil

                it's mixed.  both diffuse and concentrated

                any judge can declare a statute unconst, but its valid only for parties

                a supreme court decision is only applicable to parties

                but like in Europe, politicians can challenege a statute in the abstract

                    the resulting decision is binding throughout the counrty

                they don't have judicial referral

    ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS AND JUDICIAL REVIEW

        control by the courts over the legality administrative acts from the executive

        in civil law countries, the administration reviews itself within its own executive quasi-judicial courts

        over time, these courts become more and more judicial in nature

            eventually, they became truly independant

            (these are the conseil detat, consiglio detato, etc)

        they handle public law/administrative litigation

            a conflict between a person and the executive

            eg, vendor's license, parking tickets

        in principle, they're part of the administration, at least historically

            they are not part of the judiciary, but they act like a duck

        Conseil D'Etat

            1799, under Napoleon, beautiful building in Paris, 500 people

            used to be the conseil de roi, king could not act before hearing the council

            had the same jurisdictional role since the 1500s

                [in Saudi Arabia, this is done by the council of greivances]

        the jurisdiction of the admin courts and the regular courts are mutually exclusive

            no overlap, no choice between two systems

            in the event of a conflict of jdx, there's a council for that

                [positive conflict of jdx==two courts claim it, negative conflict of jdx==two courts disown it]

            in FR, they have the tribunal de conflict

                equal number of judges from council detat and the other one
                they decide and bind
                they hear 30-80 cases per year
                clear cut rules mostly

                    if the admin is involved in a civil claim, its civil
                    onl if its really hardcore admin law is it admin ct

            in GER, the court where you brought the claim makes the decision

                if they take it, that's it
                if they send it to admin, that's it

                the GER admin cts are part of the judiciary

            in IT, BE the court of cassation decides jdx

            There's a clear and nearly absurd conflict of interest

                these judges are picked and paid by the admin

                but they're generally considered impartial in the social mature countries


Comparative Law Day 8
02/16/16

    Inter-heirarchy conflicts

        in the US, we have one "pyramid" so no inter-pyramid conflicts

        in the civil law countries, there are at least two different supreme courts

            FR [conseil d'etat and the court de cassation]

            GER [5 supreme courts]

        when you have two supreme courts, you run the risk of two independent supreme courts taking a different tack on the same legal issue

            FR does not solve them

                (see example on p550 vegetable trucks parking spot)

                they use one interp for admin law and one for civil law

            GER has a superpanel that resolves the issue

        [the amount of strategic considerations for a civil law lawyer are negligible.  In the US, almost everything has a strategic component.  This results more from our federal structure than from our common law approach]

        EXAM QUESTION:

            The FR have a superpanel to resolve conflicts of jdx, but no superpanel to resolve conflicts between the heirarchies.

            The GER did create a superpanel to resolve inter-heirarchy conlficts, but no superpanel to resolve conflicts of jdx

    More on FR conseil detat

        300-400 members

        only a small portion (30) does the tribunal duties

        most of them give adivce to the gov on public works, finance, social issues

        100 or so work abroad at embassies

        the tribunal part is just the tip of the iceberg, the rest is way more political

    Most international treaties include only civil and commercial law

        this excludes admin law in civil law countries

    Judicial Review of Administrative Decisions in the US:

        US has judicial review of admin acts

            but its a complicated matter, so we're limited here to federal sphere

            there's a strong presumption that all agency actions are reviewable

                unless the statute expressly excludes review
                or strongly implies preclusion

                there's a camp that claims judicial review of all admin acts is a const mandate, but its not settled

            [IRS decides something in one of their courts.  can you sue them in ordinary ct? generally yes, unless the statute prohibits it.]

        unless it's clearly erroneous or an abuse of discretion, an issue of fact is settled by whatever the agency decides (usually)

        it's a balkanized world of mini, hidden admin court systems, full of art 1 judges

            [this means they have fewer protections than article 3 judges]

        if you sue an agency in an ordinary court and you win, the gov will cover attorney's fees, unless the gov's position was "substantially justified" [this contrasts to our normal rule, which is that winners do not get atty's fees]

            the rest of the world (except China and Japan) grants atty's fees to the winner (loser must pay the winner's attorney's fees)

            in some rare situations in the US, a statute will provide for fee shifting

                civil rights cases, 100 other statutes

    STYLE OF JUDICIAL OPINIONS

        US is unusual in allowing a party to draft a decision/notice/order

            winner drafts, loser reviews, judge handles any conflict

        Judgment prohibited by claims

            US: you can get more than what you ask for if judge/jury decides it FRCP54c

                except in cases of default judgment

                and you can amend your complaint

            CIVIL: judgment is limited by what you claim

                but this is mitigated by the option to bring another claim for what you forgot in your original complaint, as long as the SoL has not run

    The STYLE OF JUDICIAL OPINIONS

        In civil law countries, courts are required to give reasoned decisions

            it's a public account of weighing evidence and analyzing law

            in many countries, this is a constitutional guarantee
            in EU, it's a human right to have a decision explained

            incomplete reasoning is a reversible error

            this open decision process mitigates against the undemocratic nature of the jud

        In the common law tradition, there's generally no req for a reasoned decision

            FRCP 52a requires judges to write opinions on fact and law

            but juries don't have to account, so fact issues often go unexplained

            interlocutory decisions don't have to be reasoned or explained

                "sometimes the judges are just guessing"

        In international law, a common law judgment represents a special problem

            imagine an unexplained decision, or a default judgment, or a jury verdict

            how can it be enforced in italy or germany?

                they used to refuse to enforce judgments like these for public policy reasons

                eventually they came around by chalking it up as the nature of the CL tradition

            you can ask the court to give a reasoned decision on the issues of law

                you let him know where it needs to be enforced and the case law that reqs reas

            you can ask him to present in writing to the jury a more detailed reaonsing

            you can ask for a special verdict for the facts

                its a verdict where the jury must answer specific questions

                    eg, was the D present, was the D drunk, etc

            in this way you can get more pages of reasoning and get more respect

    DISSENTING OPINIONS

        in civil law tradition, you know the names of the judges on the panel

            but you don't know who wrote the opinion
            you dont know who voted for and against
            you don't know the vote count
            you don't know whether there was a dissent

            every decision is "per curiam" [black box]

        in US, appellate decisions are not usually per curiam

            normally, you get the name of a judge who wrote it

            bush v gore was a per curiam decision

        in Canada, the courts sometimes use per curiam decisions for controversial cases

        in the civil law tradition, dissenting opinions are usually not allowed

            sometimes there are exceptions

            the decisions are not political, so the dissent is not a big deal

                not a constitutional matter
                just technical interpretation
                there's no strong precedential effect

        in some civil law constitutional courts

            bc political and precedential, dissenting opinions are allowed

            GER for example allows dissenting opinions in their const ct

        the european court of justice does not allow dissenting opinions
        the european court of human rights does allow dissenting opinions

        the reason for forbidding dissenting opinions:

            secrecy of deliberation

            if you let the dissent attack the maj, they open up reasoning

            you don't even know if the decision was unanimous

        in the US too, nobody is allowed to hear the judges behind the curtain

            their deliberations are shielded so that they can have real talk

            the oral hearings are public, and you can get the audio online (no tv)

    REPORTING OF DECISIONS

        traditionally unimportant bc no precedential effect

        now, they're widely published and available online

            this will likely cause cases to have some precedential effect, like it or not

        in the civil law tradition, cases normally don't use party names bc privacy

    Jurisdiction

        in the US

            general jdx v specific jdx

                general: defendant's activities are so substantial that they justify jdx against that D on any cause of action. place where D is at home

                    bases:

                        domicile/place of incorporation
                        tag jdx service of process while in jdx
                        consent
                        quasi-in-rem jdx (if you have property in the state)

                specific: claim arises out of D's activities in the forum jdx. minimum contacts.  less than general jdx, but still enough to justify the claim.

                    -you need a state long arm statute
                    -the statute is constitutional
                        minimum [related] contacts
                        reasonableness
                        seek to serve

            jurisdictional discovery:

                limited to matters that establish jdx
                costs the parties money to establish
                it's more controlled by the judge

        in the civil law tradition

            they don't call it personal jdx, they say territorial competence

            most countries are not federal, and even those that are different from us

                no other nation sees their states as partly sovereign

                so no other nation does the whole minimum contacts analysis

    intl enforcement of judgments

        direct jdx of F1
        indirect jdx of F2

        you need to show jdx of F1 to adjudicate
        and then to enforce, you need to show jdx of F2

    jurisdiction by treaty

        bilateral (US and Saudi Arabia have an agreement over intl jdx)
        multilateral (bustamante code all over latin america, brussels convention in EUR)

            brussels and lugano together make for something like full faith and credit

            [BtoB means business to business]

        Since the Hague Conference failed

            currently there's no worldwide convention on jdx

        US is not a party to any bilateral, multilateral, or worldwide treaty regarding jurisdiction and recognition of judgments

            this is in sharp contrast to ARBITRATION

                the NY convention of 1958 signatories that issue an arbiter award (even a little baby country) are binding even in a powerful country

                an arbitration award is more powerful than a judgment in this sense

                Therefore, a forum selection clause or an arbitration clause are essential

        Long arm statutes:

            CA type

                I have jdx over everything that's not unconstitutional

            IL type

                I have jdx over x,y,z...

    Brussels I

        pltf may choose the place of origin or the place of harm to bring suit

    Ordinary jdx:

        domicile
        place of contract performance
        consent

    EXORBITANT JDX:

        a type of jdx peculiar to a given [small] group of countries, objectionable to others

        for example:

            domicile of the pltf
            nationality of pltf
            nationality of def
            jdx by joinder
            quasi in rem jdx
            tag jdx
            universal jdx
            place of signature of the contract

        the US exercises broad jdx, europeans are often upset to be dragged into the US

        French Nationality jdx is one of the most extreme examples of exorbitant jdx

            [this rule is suspended within the EU]

Comparative Law Day 13
03/08/16

    EXORBITANT JDX:

        jdx by joinder:  where the court has legitimate jdx over one def, the court has jdx over all def

            jdx by joinder is the FR model, which europe uses except for GER

            in the US, we have rules for necessary and indispensible parties instead

        Brussels prohibits many forms of exorbitant jdx, but only for those domiciled in EU

            it's a reciprocal agreement
            nationality is irrelevant, domicile is key

        forum non conviens

            even if the ct has jdx, the court can decline jdx bc the forum is not convenient

            it serves as a check on the broad rules of jdx

            its used more liberally for foreigners than for americans

    SERVICE OF PROCESS:

        International Aspect of Service of Process:

            extremely important

            letters rogatory

                letters of request
                made by a court in one state/country to a court in another
                types:

                    service of process
                    taking evidence
                    provisional measures
                        'could you please attacht he property of this flight risk person'

            Whether you can go to another country and perform a judicial act depends on the law of the forum country.  however, it's a diplomatic issue bc it violates their sovereignty and their laws

                they might stop cooperating
                they might start reciprocating/retaliating
                they might refuse to enforce the judgment

            Signification au parquet

                traditional french method of service of process
                service by proxy, where the proxy is the local prosecutor
                by the time the def gets notice, the case is probably already over

                outdated by the Hague convention
                    which requires a serious effort at actual service of process

                this is analogous to the Pennoyer era of American service of process

            The service of process convention is for civil and commercial matters

            Civil and Commercial Matters

                no meaning in CL
                precise definition in Civil Law

                excludes tax, admin, punitive damages cases, etc

                    anything regulatory
                    anything criminal

                a country cannot refuse service of process merely bc they would not enforce the judgment later

        Comparative Aspect of Service of Process:

            US:  it can be private, pretty liberal as far as acceptable means
                "you can hire mary to do it"
            CIVIL:  you go to the gov, and a bailiff or marshall delivers
                "you need the bailiff"

            Hague Convention on Service of Process:

                plaintiff sends a request to court/AG
                AG/ct contacts a central authority (state dept in US, eg)
                notice is served on minister of justice
                then sent to a local ct
                then served
                then back through the same channels

                this can take a full year
                it's more formalistic than "hiring mary"

                sometimes the statute of limitations is tolled when you bring the suit
                others, when you serve the process

            Strategically speaking, think about enforcement and then work backwards

    LIS PENDENS

        not taught in US civ pro
        taught in every civil law civ pro class

        whenever you have overlapping lawsuits on the same subject matter, there's a lis pendens issue

        the strategic implications of forum shopping can be dispositive in intl litigation

            because of procedural issues
            evidentiary issues
            availability of preliminary injunctions
                injunctions
                attachment of property
                [this doesnt exist in FRCP]

        in the US, each state and the feds all have their own rules on lis pendens

            courts may stay their own proceedings based on which forum is more appropriate

            there's no hard and fast rule about which proceeding trumps

            there are factors, but the extensive discretion leads to uncertainty

                where the evidence is
                who is the traditional pltf
                who got to the ct first

            in the event of a contradictory judgment, the first wins

                [race to judgment]

        In the CIVIL LAW tradition, domestically

            whoever brought the lawsuit first gets it

            its a race to the courthouse

            whichever court is seized first, has the right to try the case

            the other court must automatically dismiss its proceedings

            no questions asked.  clear "first to file" rule

        CLASSIC CONTRAST:

            the american rule is open, complex, discretionary, ambiguous, and uncertain

                tailored to the specific situation, but its unfair because its unclear

            the civil law rule is simple, fast, certain, predictable, rigid, automatic, clear, and mandatory

                it's rigid and may lead to injustice in application in a specific situation

        INTL:

            traditionally, two sovereign nations will proceed parallely

            race to judgment

            its a waste of resources and its disrespectful

            recently, one country will give deference to another nation as long as

                that country can make a judgment in a reasonable time
                and their judgment can be enforced locally

                but it still leads to a race to the courthouse

        BRUSSELS CONVENTION

            make EU operate like one country

            the jdx rules care about domicile

            the lis pendens rules don't care about domicile of the parties

                it doesnt matter who the pltfs are

        When does a law suit begin?

            it varies from state to state and country to country

            when the COMPLAINT IS FILED with the ct (FRCP 3)
            when the DEF IS FORMALLY SERVED with process
            when the court gave THE FIRST ORDER in the proceeding

Comparative Law Day 15

    PLEADINGS AND FORMATION OF ISSUES

        CIVIL:

            judge knows the law
            you give the facts
            he gives the law and the result

            not limited by the issues raised by the parties

            but in some countries,
            the judge cannot decide on an issue not raised by the parties
            without giving the parties an opportunity to present their views on the issue

            the consequence is that the judge will often help a weaker party

            GER, JPN, FRA have rules like this, but only GER has the mandatory version

            US: perhaps a similar rule, but not clear or universally followed

        CIVIL:

            less adversarial, more magisterial
            judge is there to find law and truth
            people criticize judges in this tradition as inquisitorial
            judge asks questions to witnesses

        US:

            more adversarial
            judge is like an umpire in a duel
            this is consistent with the realities of jury trials
                the judge would appear to favor one party over another
            lawyers ask questions to witnesses

        Witnesses:

            The civil law lawyer cannot interact with a witness
            before the judge has an opportunity to talk to him
            no cross examination, more civil, no need to prep

            In the US, the lawyer must talk to them before
            if you don't woodshed here, it's a violation of prof rules
            cross examination is so aggressive that you must prep a witness

    EVIDENCE AND DISCOVERY

        RULE 1: relevant evidence is admissable, irrelevant is not admissable
        RULE 2: some relevant evidence is not admissable
            bc untrustworthy or prejudicial

        US:

            authentication

                the witness who signed it/made it must testify to it
                bc of jury, you have to go through the process of authentication


        CIVIL:

            presumption that documents prove themselves

            no hearsay or exclusionary rule bc no jury trial

            there's no "trial" as a single discrete event even

                there's no pre trial and trial division
                no major discovery phase
                it's all a monolithic proceeding

            a party cannot be a witness to his or her own case

            SEE rules of evidence discussion throughout notes above

            civil law trad does not have many exclusionary rules

                there are some,
                    such as illegally obtained evidence
                    and relevance

                mostly though, they don't exist bc there's no jury to protect

                instead, civilians trust a pro judge will give fair evaluation

                also, it would be impossible to admin

                    the judge cannot act both as censor and as audience

                hearsay evidence is admitted, but then discounted
                the judge can use it to connect the dots
                but it's always devalued acoording to its nature

Comparative Law Day 16
03/24/16

    Trial or No Trial?

        the jury is the reason for the concentrated common-law jury trial

                if you take out the jury, as in the civil law,
                you don't need a concentrated hearing

            the double nature of the pretrial/trial division is inefficient

            the trial is an all-or-nothing, high stakes event

            you work like crazy in pretrial to prep, then distill for presentation at trial

            the reality of the two systems, though, is quite similar

                most cases in the US don't go to trial

                the actual process is piecemeal, without a jury, and managed by a judge

                the discovery phase is much like a civil "trial"

                here, though, discovery happens in the lawyers offices

        DISCOVERY

            US

                FRCP rules 23-36 here

                does not exist in our sense in the civil law tradition

                discovery here is a private matter,
                both parties gather evidence from opponents

                GATHER A LOT, PICK THE GOOD STUFF, SQUEEZE THE JUICE, THEN PRESENT AT TRIAL

                generally a noncontentious matter

                    the contentious ones are the ones we read, but mainly it perfunctory

                unless you contract otherwise, you can use the evidence for anything

                our discovery makes our proceedings peerlessly expensive and invasive

                SCOTUS is starting to restrict discovery, but it's still broad

                    [the combination of less political pressure and broader discovery allowed the US legal system to uncover the pattern of child molestation in the catholic church]

                the relevance std for discoverability is lower than for admissability

            TRADITIONAL COMMON LAW COUNTRIES

                they don't have depositions, except in Canada
                UK is the next broadest
                but generally much narrower

            CIVIL

                does not exist like above
                but theyre beginning to adopt it recently
                    in fra, ned, ger, jap, eng
                        here you can get a specific doc you know of and can describe
                            you ask the judge, and the judge has to ask the opponent
                        also some judges may ask for a doc that's referenced consistently
                15 years ago, there was none

                there's something like a privilege against incrimination in civil context

                the narrower discovery means less access to info

                shifting burden of proof sometimes can act to mitigate this lesser access

                everyone has "de bene esse" pseduo deposition to preserve testimony

                    its used where a person is about to die

                the process of gathering info is not separated from presenting to judge

                    the "discovery" is part of the "trial"
                    contrasts to US separation of disco and trial

            INTERNATIONAL LITIGATION

                discovery rules are a big factor for deciding where to sue
                pltf wants to sue in US, if they need info
                pltf wants to sue in GER if they have all the info they need

                strategy:

                    sue in tokyo for the actual trial (bc only place with jdx)
                    second suit in US (even if maybe no jdx) just to obtain evidence

                        you can stay the would-be no jdx or forum non conveniens dismissal
                        judge will often let the discovery finish
                        no sweat about atty fees

                "as a moth is attracted to the light, so is a pltf attracted to the US judicial system"

        PARTY AND WITNESS STATEMENTS

            CIVIL

                party and witness are mutually exclusive

Comparative Law Day 17
03/29/16

PARTY AND WITNESS STATEMENTS CONT

    CIVIL

        party and witness are mutually exclusive

        in some, party cannot testify at all
        others, can testify but not under oath
        others, can call opponent to witness stand

        your lawyer tells your story on your behalf

            but its not evidence

    US

        you can testify and create evidence on your behalf
        you can actually be the sole evidence
        a single victim's testimony can create a conviction

    CIVIL

        loves written evidence
        so they require that contracts above a token amount are written

EVIDENTIARY HEARING (THE CIVIL LAW "TRIAL")

    CIV

        no clear division between trial and pretrial
        theres a piecemeal method
        no separation between acquisition and presentation
        you interview a witness, and he leads to other evidence
            just like in pretrial phase in US
            its just like discovery, but judge is present
        the idea of relevance is more narrow and controlling in civil
        civil law is much less expensive
        in the civil law tradition, you can litigate over a bad driveway

    US

        bc there's a trial, we must have pretrial to prep
        pretrial procedure: most poised to get facts and info, but most expensive
        an economically viable case here must meet a much higher bar

EXPERT EVIDENCE

    US

        experts are appointed by the parties

        though, FRE allow for a judge to appoint a neutral expert
            though they don't bc it's costly, and who pays?
            and also bc they don't want the jury to know of the neutral expert

        advantages:
            works closely with the party
            paid by hour, works hard to build a complete report

        problems:
            terrible conflict of interest
            experts may tailor their science/publications to meet the needs of clients
                "there is such a thing as affluenza" will get you a lot of work
                "repression" psychologists get hired to overcome SoL issues
                they get themselves convinced of a thing, even in their hearts
            we've come to expect and account for partisan experts
            in a "battle of the experts" reasonable doubt inevitably remains

    CIVIL

        experts are appointed by courts

        and the loser pays his fee
        the court appoints from a registry
        they work for the judge, who contracts them
        they're more neutral bc of the payment structure
        the party with the burden of proof pays the money up front to the judge
        and then the judge pays the expert
        and after, the loser foots the bill

        but also, each party can hire an "assessor" expert
            first to understand the situation
            then to undertand the report prepared by the court's expert
            then to discuss with the court's expert
            and then to influence methodology and conctent of the final report
            you can also use your expert to challenge the court's expert
                he normally sides with the court's expert, though

        problem:

            "schools of thought" problem:
                picking an expert from one school of law picks an outcome
            this expert is a bureaucrat without incentives to work hard

    EXAM:

        2-3 topics
        essay format
        we answer from a comparative perspective
        talk about expert witness, constitutional court in comparative perspective

    DISCOVERY AND GATHERING EVIDENCE ABROAD

        requires international judicial cooperation

        US: anything before trial has a private flavor, with a dash of public
        CIV: the whole process, every aspect is performed by a gov official

        this disparity causes trouble when the two systems interact

        Hague Process:

            I talk to my court
            my court talks to foreign country
            foreign country talks to foreign court
            ct complies
            then evidence goes back through the channels

            it takes a year and a half and results in a half-baked answer

        Blocking Statutes:

            prohibit (and sometimes even criminalize) compliance with discovery orders
            in FRA, requesting it is a crime, performing it is a crime

            it's about sovereignty
            and also about protecting the special industries trade secrets

                however, the FR changed domestic law to help accommodate foreigners
                for the foreigners:
                    they allow verbatim transcripts
                    they allow direct questions
                    they allow presence of a foreign judge

        AEROSPATIALE

            to what extent must a fed US district ct
            in a case in the US
            employ the hague evidence convention rules
            when litigants seek discovery over the FR def
            when the FR def is in the personal jdx of the ct

            FR def files for a protective order
                under hague convention
                under intl comity
                under the FR blocking statute

                he doesn't want to give up the evidence against himself

            PLTF says I only need hague convention for
            evidence about a person who I lack personal jdx over

            SCOTUS: in US, hague convention is only for 3rd parties
            if ct has jdx over def, no need for hague process
            pltfs can rely on brutal US discovery rules instead
                is local law says you get some evidence, you get it
            the hague convention is not mandatory
                it's a permissive supplement to american law

                DISSENT: try the formal way first

            how you play this depends on where you need to enforce the jdgmt
            the costs of this also include reciprocity

            "You should secure the way back." -Palestinian Proverb

    FINALITY OF JUDGMENTS & PRECLUSION

    US

        claim preclusion

            res judicata is almost universal
            all systems have a rule about finality of judgments
                once it's been determined on the merits judicially
                the parties cannot bring a second claim on the same cause of action

            the same claim that was the object of a proceeding is decided absolutely
            you cannot sue again on the same claim

            In the US, in addition
                any claim about the same transaction or occurrence will be precluded
                you have to bring everything related to the issue all at once
                this is known as a prohibition on "splitting the cause of action"
                    no claim splitting

        issue preclusion

            an issue that was a necessary step to the final conclusion
            if it was litigated and part of a final judgment
            cannot be relitigated

                if the validity of a contract was handled within a bigger suit
                the issue is precluded, and cannot be relitigated

    CIVIL

        claim preclusion

            only the same exact claim is precluded
            no rule against claim splitting

            in GER, you can litigate the first 10 bucks of a 100.000 suit
            and then sue later for the remainder
            this is done to control costs and avoid costly fee shifting

            more common is splitting the damage to the car from the damage to my legs

        issue preclusion

            generally, in principle, no issue preclusion
            the preclusion is limited to the holding
            the necessary steps are not precluded and can be relitigated

            issue preclusion exists in PRT and GRE and maybe in ESP

    FORMULA IN US:

        liberal pleadings, liberal discovery, etc
        but the liberality ends when the proceeding ends
        then we have very restrictive res judicata

        we proceed slowly and thoroughly and then its DONE

    FORMULA IN CIV:

        strict pleadings, strict discovery, etc
        but then a very liberal res judicata
        you can bring related claims
        and litigate stuff you didn't know about

PARTIE CIVILE

    US

        civil and criminal suits are separate

    CIVIL

        pltf can bring an independent civil action or
        pltf can choose to piggyback onto a criminal proceeding
        judge adds money damages onto the criminal conviction
        you get to use the info of the police investigation
            so you get discovery, which is unusual in civ
        speedier, and cheaper
        negligent torts are often crimes in europe

ATTORNEY'S FEES

    lawyers abroad are generally compensated better than non-lawyers
    but they make less money than US lawyers, generally
    but they graduate without any debt bc all school is public
    cost of living is higher, cost of education is cheaper

    CONTINGENCY FEES:

        US:

            if I make money for you, I get a cut
            if I fail, I get nothing
            creates a conflict of interest
            incentivizes litigation
                even here we forbid them in criminal and family cases
            but without contingency fees, the costs of litigation here are too high
                it would close the doors of the courthouse to many

            Formula:

                open advert
                lawyer pays the costs
                1/3 contingency fee

                the result is that the litigation is an investment

        C/L:

            british called it "spec" as in speculation, but in 2013, they allowed it

        CIV:

            pactum quota litis
            pact to buy a piece of the litigation
            its a nastier name, shows general distaste
            reflects that lawyer becomes a party

            contingency fees are against public policy in most civil law countries

            two effects:

                -where no contingency fees, you have to pay whether you win or lose
                    like a doctor.  lawyer promises only effort.
                -lawyers cannot charge a percentage of the recovery

            unlawful & unethical to enter an agreement giving lawyer a stake in the case

    FEE SHIFTING:

        generally, loser pays winner's cost

        US:

            loser pays costs, but not attorney's fees or discovery expenses
            US, China, and Japan have this rule

            there are hundreds of statutory fee-shifting statutes
                most of them are one-way
                pltf gets fees but not def

            juries may inflate damages, especially punitive
                you wanna give her one? okay, then three
                one for the shark, one for the cost, one for her

        CIV AND C/L:

            we call it the English rule
            loser pays the winner's reasonable expenses

            when people contract, they always provide for fee shifting
                it's the natural way


    Foreign Law in Domestic Law

        growing all the time

        you need to know or retain a foreign lawyer
        you need to know enough law to hire a good one

        foreign in domestic:

            rules of conflict of laws may require application of Italian law
            legitimacy determinations for immigration law req foreign legitimacy law
            foreign corrupt practice act reqs reference to foreign law
                for who is a public official
                for whether it was illegal/corrupt
                otherwise it's a violation of foreign law and US law
            also, it may be advisable to follow foreign law when you need enforcement

            when you have to prove foreign law in a trial, you have to plead it
                you must raise it (like an affirmative defense)
                then it's proven as if it's an issue of fact
                    you can sometime consult the embassy
                but then it's treated as a ruling on a question of law

        ROPER v SIMMONS

            case on U18 death penalty
            employs foreign law to reach conclusion

            issue: whether the US can apply the death penalty to minors consistently with the 8thA, or is it unconstitutional as cruel and unusual

            it used to be acceptable, but now there's a global consensus against it

            HOLDING: U18 death penatly is now cruel and unusual today

            arg: standards of decency have evolved.  it's no longer civilized.

                also, sociological evidence
                also, states were abandoning it

                there's a growing national consensus, court decides to speed it up

                just like ATKINS a few years earlier. no execution of mentally retardeds

            then, as a kicker, he mentions that the US is the only remaining country
                then he says that its not controlling only confirmatory

            only the US and Somalia did not ratify the UN convention on rights of kids

            SCALIA'S DISSENT:

                slippery slope, where do we stop?

                you want change? get it from the legislature
                the job of the court is not to read a right into the constitution

                changing stds of decency are good enough to change the law
                but not enough to declare it unconstitutional

HISTORY

    JUSTINIAN

        CORPUS JURIS CIVILIS

            year 530

            is like a sixth century ALI Restatement

            aggregation of opinions grows into an unmanagable body of law
            the political power consolidates it into a single authoritative body
            those who compiled had the power to add content and commentary

            "Most influential book of all time." -GIDI

            INSTITUTES

                it's a hornbook for students that also has binding legal power
                2/3 based on the work of GAIUS who worked 4 centuries earlier yr160
                covers family law, property, wills, torts, contracts, and procedure
                    1L year for ancient jurists

            DIGEST

                2L-4L year for ancient law students, also binding law
                compilation from 38 top jurists, 1/3 from Ulpianus yr250
                divided by topics, looks like a dictionary of quotations
                like an encyclopedia of the best law, a patchwork of bits
                reduced 2000 books into 50
                most important part, most sophisticated

            CODEX

                compilation of imperial decrees, compilation of statutes
                studied in the 5L year of ancient law school

            NOVELLAE

                the laws passed by justinian after completion of the codex
                it's like the supplement or the pocket part

        Justinian died without codifying the new rules

        Rome was Christian by the time of the corpus
        but the materials come from the pagan era
        the famous Roman jurists were all pagan

        Justinian considered it complete, coherent, absolute, eternal and perfect
        He issued an order that forbid citation to other legal texts
            he even prohibited citation to the omitted parts of digested works
            he also forbid books of interpretation
            he even forbid the development of binding case law

        Justinian asserterted a complete absence of actual contradictions

        This work provides the definition of a civil law country

            any country that adopted as binding or highly persuasive
            any country that adopted a system from Europe

            not a country with a code, but a country with CJC as a code

            even England was substantially influenced by it, but never adopted it

        The western Roman empire falls in the late 400s

        Justinian's death is the death of Roman Law

            the corpus juris is a snapshot of roman law right at the death of roman law
                this is in the yr530
            the romans never saw the corpus juris, they had the originals

        EASTERN EMPIRE

            Byzantine law is a continuation of Roman Law with strong greek influence

                the culture, language, and values are different
                so the corpus juris lost power
                the roman tradition declined

                it's the foundation of greek law, the greek church, and several balkans

        1803 Napoleon enacts the French Civil Code

        WESTERN EUROPE AFTER THE FALL OF ROME

            after yr476

            the roman light was extinguished and europe is thrown into the dark ages
            the rich roman law tradition is mostly forgotten
            for 600 years nothing comparable exists
            German law is influenced by roman law, but minimally
            the caricature of roman law known as vulgar roman law endures

            pretty much, roman law disappeared

            yr1070 a newly minted Italian law professor rediscovered the CJC

                the romans rediscovered roman law!

            this discovery started "THE RECEPTION"
                this starts the story of another 1000 years

                from rediscovery in 11th until the 19th century, its binding law
                    not considered a work of history for 800years
                    rather cited as authority
                only loses its binding authority with modern states and codification
                    napoleon did the same as justinian, forbid other books on law
                    it became history only after the codes
                    still then it was used to explain modern law

            CJC still binding in scotland, south africa, andorra, san marino, sri lanka

            ROUGH TIMELINE
                -500 to 500 continuous development
                600 to 1070 it pauses (maybe it goes backwards)
                1070 to now continuous development
                for 1000 years, all of Europe has the IUS COMMUNE

        CODIFICATION: choose what's good, reject what's bad, forbid everything else

    IUS COMMUNE

        11th Century by the end of it, Italian Scholars rediscover the digest and CJC
        this discovery helped to restart the renaissance
        the italians knew of the existence of the CJC, but did not know its contents
        creates a new school of thought and a wave of literature

        BOLOGNA law school

            founded in 1088

        the first judicial decision in italy to re-adopt the CJC as authority was 1076

            but this trend grew when the judges recognized the value of roman law
            especially as the increasingly complexity of medieval life grew

        this resumption of roman law as binding is part of what's known as "THE RECEPTION"

        THE RECEPTION

            happened slowly, and throughout continent
            slower and faster in some parts, more complete and less
            but everywhere, a private law emerged that was strongly influenced by roman law

            the revival mechanism was the CJC

                the scholars did not go directly to the roman law scholars
                bc too difficult to find those books

            the 11thC europeans were mesmerized by the CJC and its sophistication

                it started in Italy and then slowly spread throughout the continent
                the stone drops in bologna, the ripple carries out across Europe

            by the 15th C, the reception was complete in spain, ned, fr, ger

            but the reception continued through up until the 19thC

        Latin was the first English and Bologna was the LLM degree

            it became the model for legal education across the continent
            all over Europe, the lawyers had the same training in the same language
            it created a globalized legal culture with shared traditions
            and the law school curriculum followed the Justinian model

        in the middle ages, the law was marked by pluralism of law

            first, look to local law
            then, look to other authorities
            roman law filled in the gaps

            with time, local laws came to be written by roman law scholars
            in this way, it became the substance
            but also it was the framework of analysis for interpretation

        THREE LIVES OF THE ROMAN LAW

            in rome itself as original sources
            in byzantium as the CJC
            in europe in the late middle ages and early renaissance

        The IUS COMMUNE was a "soup" of different law

            with different power in different times and places
            in this soup, roman law was the broth

        CJC was binding authority throughout europe in any case where local law was not

            in italy, roman law was adopted as binding because
                politics: separates politics from pop
                economics: roman law coped better with medieval complexity

        With FR revolution & the development of nation-states, the era of Ius Commune ends

            notions of sovereignty as a single source of law displaces
            the idea of a state that enacts law begins

        ENGLAND during the time of the IUS COMMUNE

            they were influenced by CJC and Canon law too, but
            by the time the IUS COMMUNE hit England, they alreayd had an established system
            the very mechanics of the common law system were not receptive to roman law

            the universities had a lesser influence too

                lawyers were trained in inns of court, not in universities
                by distancing the lawyers from university, the law became insulated
                oxford and cambridge followed the Bologna method, but didnt make lawyers

            the power of writs and precedents was antithetical to rationality of roman law

            scholars like Blackstone were heavily influenced by CJC and roman law

                he was a prof of roman law at oxford
                his commentaries followed the structure of the institutes
                he was widely published in the US, and influenced US law with roman flavor

            despite the heavy influence of roman law, england never received the CJC

                it accepted ideas from roman law, but never its methods

            CANON LAW also exerted influence on england

            Also, way back, (0-600) England was part of the Roman Empire

                so the common law of England is also the law of the Roman Empire
                but from its first life, -500 to 500 roughly

        Another look on the same timeframe

            Faces of interpretation:

                GLOSSATORS

                    11thC-13thC
                    early efforts by the italians
                    wrote annotations to the text of the CJC
                    its like dropping a footnote today
                        defining a word, offering interpretation, cross referencing
                    they also published treatises
                    but they were most famous for their Glossae annotated version of CJC
                    by harmonizing and systematizing, they made the CJC available again
                    they were the marketers of the CJC for the reception
                    the later books are better because they build on the past work
                    this lasted until 1250, and a guy collected them all up
                        he created the Glossa Ordinaria with 100,000 footnotes
                        this version became the one used in the following centuries
                        it doubled the size of the CJC
                    They had no sense of chronology, they did not see it as a historic doc

                COMMENTATORS

                    14thC-15thC
                    they went beyond the Glossators, they tried to modernize and adapt
                    they think they know better than the romans now
                    theyd update and mix with canon law and glossae
                    more useful to the practitioner
                    this would make the glossae binding now too
                    this is when the rest of Europe started to receive roman law
                    this starts the tradition of powerful important civilian scholarship

                HUMANISTS

                    16thC...
                    they're french renaissance men
                    they turn back to the study of the classics
                    they go all the way back to the originals
                    they clean up the mess after the centuries of careless modification
                    they read ulpian and gaius, etc
                    -500 to 300 was their wheelhouse
                    they compared the original gaius with the institutes
                        they discovered the interpolations of Justinian's men
                        they discovered that which was omitted from CJC
                    they criticized the work of the Justinian committee
                    they despised the commentators and the gloassators for corrupting
                    they also criticized the notion that CJC was really roman law

                    but they forget that without the CJC, there'd be no reception
                    and therefore no humanists
                    justinian saved roman law

                    they were the first to really see the roman law as historical
                    they criticized the inadequacy of roman law for modern times

                    they promoted the development of local law

                    they're academic ivory tower types, less influential on practice

                ROMAN DUTCH JURISPRUDENCE

                    17th-18th Centuries
                    revived the italians, took the french out of their ivory tower
                    made roman law viable until codification
                    they assumed the torch from the FR and ITA

                NATURAL LAW

                    as distinguished from positive law
                    natural law is the law given by god or by reason or nature
                    positive law is the one imposed by the sovereign

                    its a notion of immutable law separate from applied law

                    Thomas Aquinas gave birth to the religious version of this notion

                    universally applicable and true

                    then grew the secular version

        NATIONAL DEVEOPMENTS

            this considers the period after ius commune but before codification
            marked a shift from natural law to positivism
                ended the era of invoking authority
            dictators have an easier time enacting codes

            ITALY

                1870 shifting kingdoms
                then unified by giribaldi

            GERMANY

                1870 bismark unified

                before then, they relied on common-law type custom
                but even these were pseudo-codified in authoritative books

                the CJC (5% of roman law) was more comprehensive than 1700-1900 GER law
                    p353

                1881 GER started to work on their own code
                1888 GER publishes first draft, but not approved
                1896 GER publishes second draft, this one approved
                1900 Jan 1 code goes into effect (nearly a full 1c after FR code)

                GER code is more precise, and written for attorneys

            FRANCE

                france was unifed as a nation several centuries before GER and ITA
                civil code in 1804 unifed the law
                    before then, there were 300ish laws
                    voltaire said, you change laws more often than horses

                FR can effectively be divided into two: north and south
                    north: customary law (though consolidated)
                    south: written law

                1804 CODE NAPOLEON

                    first modern codification

                    erased the north-south divide
                    was not his idea, monarchy had tried
                    1791 national assembly declared that there should be one code

                    this was a bloody, sharp transition from old regime to new
                        contrast to a mellower version in GER

                    Napoleon commissioned 4 prominent legal scholars

                        the most prestigious and most knowledgeable got the job
                        they had the power to invent and create and modify
                        but basically they built out of the old materials
                        napoleon was actively involved

                4 main codes:

                    civil
                    civ pro
                    criminal
                    crim pro

                FR code was a pamphlet to be read by lay people
                    its still studied by FR high school students

                FR civil code grows out of a distrust of judges
                    explains reliance on code over precedent
                    inevitably, intepretations "take hold"

            SPAIN

                obtained national unity before FR
                8thC to 15thC spain was held by arabs
                in 13thC they enacted siete partidas code

            JAPAN

                become convinced by the merit of the GER system after study
                they translated the GER civil code and civ pro code in Japanese
                it's a literal translation of the GER law
                they studied, translated, and enacted the first draft even before GER

            ENGLAND

                courts of equity rise in response to the brutal formalism of the law courts
                US has equitable remedies still even without courts of equity
                more influenced by canon law and roman law

        LEX MERCATORIA

            international business associations in EUR settled on a system
            they needed a flexible, modern, uniform legal system
            the law merchant became the std, and spread through EUR
            ITA merchants created an international banking std
            this informal law dies in the 17thC when govs start to issue the same rules
                then they became known as commercial law
                FR and GER would later enact commercial codes

    CODIFICATION

        part of the continuum of the life of the civil law tradition

        CODES GENERALLY

            throughout time, this was attempted by kings etc they enacted compilations
            but the FR was the first to enact a code in the modern sense

            a code's OBJECTIVE is

                to contain the entire law related to the subject
                and to be a break with the past

                a code is not a compilation or a collection
                    its a break as well in methodolgy
                    its a firewall on backwards-looking law

                citations to scholars and past law are for historical analysis
                    no longer binding bc of exclusivity of the code
                    it's like legislative history
                    whether its evidence of keeping or abandoning, its use is interpretive
                    but ambiguity should first be resolved by looking to the code first

            FR code comments:
                "I know nothing of civil law, I only know the Code Napoleon." prof
                "Mon code est perdu" Napoleon on hearing of publication of commentary

            IDEOLOGY of CODIFICATION

                18thC rationality
                creating concepts to apply to future cases
                contrast to american tradition where a case is resolved in itself
