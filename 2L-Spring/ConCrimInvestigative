Day 1
1/13/16

    Intro:

            Gouldin:  Don't transcribe the class

            This is the cops-and-robbers course
            Con Crim Adj is the bail-to-jail

            No statutory law in this course, lots and lots of cases

        System Actors:

            Prosecutors- bring charges and decide which to bring, plea deals (+95%)

            Defense- 5th and 6th amendment rights to counsel

            Police/Investigator- make arrests, gather info/conduct searches, interrogation, decide which crimes to investigate, preventative/regulatory harrassment

            Legislators- define crimes and define sentence ranges, lots of things are criminal

            Judges- issue warrants, admit evidence, drive sentencing

            Grand Jury- formal charging

            Informants!

        Themes:

            Gap between ideal and actual system

                assmebly line/crime control v. obstacle course/due process

            Relationship between procedural requirements and underlying offense

            Practical/Strategic application of procedural requirements

            Impacts of technology

            The difficulty of reconciling system goals

                accuracy (truth-seeking function)
                privacy
                liberty (limited gov)
                security (impact of 9/11 realigned priorities)
                efficiency (resource constraints)
                fairness (discretion, racial disparities)

        The FOURTH AMENDMENT

            4thA is divided into reasonableness clause and warrant clause

                a warrant means the search or seizure is reasonable

            it protects the right of "the people"

                that is, US people.  not US citizens overseas, not foreigners, maybe illegals

            it "protects" against the government

            what counts as unreasonable is the inquiry of this course

            "seizures" include people and stuff

            "shall not be violated" is silent on remedies


Days 2 & 3
1/20/16

    What is the purpose of the 4th amendment?

        -protecting individual privacy
        -regulating the police

    What questions are answered by Katz?

        -WAS THERE A SEARCH?

            [this is a key question.  first question in every case]

        -DID THE SEARCH COMPLY WITH THE 4TH?

            they would have needed a warrant back then
            otherwise, it would have needed to have been "reasonable"

        -WHAT IS THE REMEDY?

            exclusionary rule to suppress

    KATZ

        KATZ gives us the "reasonable expectation of privacy" approach

        bookie in a phone booth.  gov places a bug on the outside of the booth.

        OLMSTEAD had said that there had to be a trespass, KATZ overturned that

        HOLDING:  in katz's favor bc the gov's warrantless search violated his privacy

        "the 4th amendment protects people, not places"

        outcome:  evidence suppressed

        REOP = Reasonable Expectation of Privacy

        TEST: Harlan's concurrence

            -subjective (actual) expectation of privacy
            -reasonable/legitimate expectation of privacy

    HESTER

        p370

        bootlegger caught selling whiskey, cops had trespassed onto his property and observed from 100 yards

        rule: the 4th amendment rights do not apply to open fields

        the curtilage is the area surrounding the house

    OLIVER

        guy growing pot, cops walk a mile onto his property, passing no trespassing signs

        HOLDING:  not a search, never REOP in "open fields"

        fields aren't sacred private spaces

        OPEN FIELDS: area outside curtilage

            "An open field need be neither 'open' nor a 'field'"

    DUNN

        CURTILAGE:

            -distance from house
            -presence of enclosure
            -nature of use of area
            -steps taken to protect the area form observation

        cops walk onto a property and peek into a barn

    CIRAOLO/RILEY

        p372

        cops flying over and observing from above

        C: 1000 ft in a plane
        R: 400 ft in a helicopter

        both observed pot plants

        Was this a search?

            3 approaches:

                -commercial flight traffic is common today, no REOP
                -cops didn't violate FAA regs therefore public coulda been there, no REOP
                -who has the burden of proving amount of air traffic?

    BOND

        p376

        border patrol feels up a bag while checking on immigration status, he finds a brick

        squeezing the bag goes beyond what you expect to happen to your bag on a bus

        [sometimes consent is enough, but here he got consent based on an initial search]

        the touch/squeeze difference is hard to determine, and easily manipulated by cops

    HOFFA

        4th does not protect your trust interest in a colleague who is actually a narc

        if you tell somebody something, you have no privacy interest in it

        this case relies on the recollection of the guy who was there

    WHITE

        whether the 4th bars testimony betwen white and an informant where the conversation was heard via electronic bug

        the informant was not available to testify, so this case relies on a wire recording

        he had an actual but not a reasonable expectation of privacy

        R: you lose control of the info you share with another person

        POLICY: this rule suppresses authentic natural daily interactions

            but there are some crimes you couldn't police without these tools

    MILLER/SMITH

        3rd party doctrine cases

        IF YOU GIVE YOUR INFO TO A 3RD PARTY, YOU HAVE NO REOP

    GREENWOOD

        do you have a REOP in your trash?

            NO REOP IN TRASH

        if you do, then it's a search for them to root through it

        the court says no, you have no REOP

            bc "we can't expect the police to avert their eyes" from that which is in public

                but it's in an opaque bag

                    c/a but any kid, snoop, or animal could have strewn it about

                but there's a reg that requires residents to place the trash on the curb weekly

                    c/a you're handing it to a 3rd party

                        c/c/a but it gets intermingled with other trash

    DOW CHEMICAL

        aerial snooping over a chemical plant is ok bc it's a regulated commercial facility

        they used enhanced photography

    KYLLO

        the court finds a search where the cops had used a thermal camera to detect the thermal signature of a pot growing operation

        TEST:  how prevalent and available is the technology used?

        it's a search because of the uncommon method used and it's not limited to observing things outside the home.

        HOME HAS SPECIAL PROTECTION UNDER THE 4TH AMENDMENT

    KNOTTS

        ether beeper case 1

        no 4th violation bc no REOP in your movements

        the tech is the issue here, and they lose on that

    KARO

        ether beeper case 2

        key difference:  this beeper goes inside several different homes

        the wholesale acceptance of a bugged barrel is the hangup here

        part of your property rights include a right to not have a bug in your drum

        so maybe this is a seizure

    JONES

        "this upends 4th amendment jurisprudence"

        GPS bug placed on D's car

        Scalia sees the trespass as enought to qualify the bug as a 4th amendment event

            revives the Olmstead view

        two technical problems complicate things

            day 11 on a ten day warrant
            in wrong jdx

        HOLDING: GPS bug is a search bc it's a trespass and they have intent to gather info

            this test is added to KATZ now

            KNOW THE HOLDING, KNOW THE CONCURRENCES

        ALITO:  the tech is cheap, so no kyllo issue. 4 weeks of snooping is too much

            Time and Cost of tech play here

Day 4
1/25/16

    Search Analysis:

        1- was there a search?
            -katz REOP test
            -jones/jardines trespassory interest
        2- if yes, did the search comply with the requirements of the fourth amendment?
        3- if no, what is the remedy?

        big secondary questions:

            -is it a HOME being searched?
            -what is the intent of the cop?

    JONES CONTINUED

        SCALIA'S Elements of Trespass Test

            -a trespass occurs
            -the trespass is onto an enumerated 4thA item
            -it occurs with the purpose/intent to find something or obtain info

        ALITO'S CONCURRENCE

            maj overemphasizes trespass
            issue is actually duration
            3rd Party Doctrine
            he likes the REOP test from KATZ
            property considerations

            no GPS bugs.  follow the old fashioned way only.

                a process hurdle in the way causes police to make better decisions.
                more resources req'd means cops only pursue the bad bad guys

    KNOTTS/KARO/JONES RECAP

        -trespass is a problem with beepers (jones)
        -[tech+duration] is a problem

        these cases can be harmonized RE trespass
        knotts: no REOP in your movements on public thoroughfares
        karo: beeper drum moves into several different homes, special protection

    CABALLES

        gloss on PLACE (H: drug sniffing dog in airport is not a search bc they only disclose the presence of narcotics/contraband)

        drug sniffing dog rule extended to traffic stops

        not a search unless it unreaosnably extends the length of the seizure

    PLACE

        90 min of holding luggage is problematic.  exceeds the scope of a Terry stop

    JARDINES

        F: drug sniffing dog detects pot smell.  they go and get a warrant, and find pot.

        ISSUE: was the dog sniff a search that invalidates the later warrant?

        police used device not in public use (analogy to thermal camera in kyllo)
        this is in the porch of a HOME (this makes it less like place and caballes)

        RULE: dog sniff is not a search

        GOV would argue:  dog sniff is not a search

            C/A, this is after jones

                there's a physical trespass on the curtilage of the home

                    gov: though, there's an implied license to approach a porch

                but not to snoop aggressively or "look into" the house

                    gov: "knock and talk" is ok under the 4th

                    and place and caballes say dog sniff is not search bc narrow

                this is different bc they brought superdog

                    gov: dogs are an ancient and common tool in copland

                    and a normal human could have smelled it w/o dog

        HOLDING:
            the gov's use of trained police dogs
            to investigate the home and its immediate surroundings
            is a search within the meaning of the 4thA

    DRAYTON

        F:  cops get on bus, one posts up at front, one posts up at rear, one moves through cabin hassling passengers

            they consent to some searches, and get into some trouble

        I: did the police seize the passengers by taking control of the bus?

            if yes, everything afterwards is tainted

        how do we know when someone is seized?

            whether they are free to leave/terminate the enounter

            RULE: a person is not seized when he has freedom to leave (mendenhall) or free to terminate the encounter (this adapts the rule to the bus context)

            factors:

                -number of cops
                -threatening presence
                -weapon display or presence
                -physical touching
                -language and tone (asking or directing)

            It's not enough that the D did not feel free.  A reasonable person std instead.
            We consider reasonable, innocent, [white?] cilvilians.

            Cop's subjective experience not determinative either.

        HOLDING:  because they did not ask to leave the encounter, they consented to the seizure and in turn their consent to the search was effective

            11th C: the cop should have to inform the subject of his right to terminate

            SCOTUS:  no obligation to inform the subject of his freedom to leave

    4THA SEIZURE ANALYSIS:

        -was there a 4thA seizure?
        -if yes, did the seizure comply with the reqs of the 4thA
        -if no, what is the remedy?

            this does not turn on the officer's intent

        an arrest is the classic seizure

            cops needs probable cause to arrest
            but not always a warrant

        a Terry Stop is another type

            cop needs reasonable suspicion
            and can frisk you for safety

        a DWI checkpoint is a seizure

            but its reasonable under certain guidelines, even without suspicion

        a MENA style "search warrant seizure" does not require reasonable suspicion or PC

        [ostensibly, a cop cannot use a refusal to stay and talk as grounds for R/S]

    HODARI

        police pursuit case

        RULE: stopping in response to police, or cop laying a hand are seizures

        RULE: a fleeing suspect is not seized by police

        physical force seizure: when cop touches suspect
        show of authority seizure: when suspect submits to cop's authority

        here, a guy tossed crack while chased by cop

        he was not seized bc he had not yet SUBMITTED to the cop's authority

Day 5
1/27/16

    EXAM:  is access of cell site metadata a search?

        Know these cold: Jones, Katz, Kyllo

    Was there a seizure?  Draw on the four seizure rules:

    FOUR SEIZURE RULES

        -MENDENHALL/DRAYTON:

            not a seizure if a normal person would feel free to leave/end
            no requirement for cops to advise freedom to terminate

            factors:

                number of officers
                threatening presence
                weapon display
                physical touching
                language/tone

        -BROWER:

            purely accidental stop does not trigger 4thA
            but driver who collided with roadblock was seized

        -BRENDLIN: when you've stopped the driver, you've stopped everyone in the car

        -HODARI: fleeing suspect is not seized by pursuing gov agents.

            only force by cop or submission by suspect counts as a seizure

    EXAM PREP:

        know what questions to ask, know what cases require them

    Practice Problem Review:

        -duration
        -pretense
        -technology v manpower
        -threat as seizure
        -search of info trusted to a 3rd party
        -home, car, person get special analysis

        From the start of a search analysis, decide whether it's a REOP analysis or a TRESPASS analysis

        Be prepared to analyze a new technology (super cocaine sniffer)

            is it more like PLACE/JARDINES or KYLLO?

        Seizure:

            Conditional language by cops about freedom to leave cuts in favor of a seizure
            Blocked exits
            Number of officers

        Third Party Doctrine

    ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK:

        1- was there a search or seizure?
            if no search or seizure, no 4thA application
        2- if yes, did the cops comply with the 4thA requirements?
            traditional model
                warrant and PC required
                exceptions to warrant reqs
            reasonableness model
        3- if no, what is the remedy?

    ABOVE IS ALL ABOUT DEFINING 4thA SEARCHES AND SEIZURES

    NOW, WE'RE TALKING COMPLIANCE

    Is there even a warrant requirement?

        some interpret the 4th to mean: no warrant requirement
        the 4th is about requirements for when you do get a warrant
        not a req that you always get one

        these people advance the "reasonable" part more than the "warrant" part

    Adequacy of a Warrant:

        -Neutral decisionmaker
            no bias COOLIDGE
            no dough CONNALLY
            no req of legal training SHADWICK
            no in-person req McNEELY/RILEY

        -Probable cause

        -Particularity

        -Oath/Affirmation

            Affidavit must be comprehensive, no sandbagging WHITELY
            Affidavit must be true, no twisting or omitting FRANKS

        -Time, Place, Manner

Day 6
2/1/2016

    Warmup:

        [The 4thA] protection consists in requiring that
        those inferences be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate,
        instead of being judged by the officer
        engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.

        An evaluation before the search is better because it mitigates the effect of hindsight bias

        When police have to seek a warrant before hand, two ex ante judgments have been made.

    ["reasonable suspicion" is a term saved for terry stops]

    WILSON:  you have to knock and announce unless there's a reason not to

        exceptions: officer safety, preservation of evidence

            exception from BANKS: reasonable suspicion of an exigency

                the rule after wilson and banks:

                no blanket exception to knock and announce for felony drug cases, but if no one's at the door within 15-20 seconds, kick it in

    "Search Warrant Seizures"

        SUMMERS: you can detain occupants of the target without suspicion during a search

        MENA: you can handcuff occupants for 2-3 hours during a search

        BAILEY: no detention of a guy who left when he's a mile away

            they had RS to stop him, but probably not PC to arrest him and movie him

            BAILEY imposes a geographical limitation on SUMMERS

    "Sneak and Peak Warrants" 429

        cops can allow a search without giving notice to the occupants (before or after) if court believes notice of the execution of the warrant will screw things up

            30 day limit or longer if justifiable

        this comes up mostly in the national security context (PATRIOT ACT)

    PROBABLE CAUSE BEGINS HERE

    BRINEGAR 432

        PC exists when

            the facts and circumstances
            within the cops' knowledge
            and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information
            are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution
            in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed

    YOU NEED PC TO ARREST OR TO SEARCH OR TO SEIZE

    NATHANSON: mere affirmance of belief or suspicion is not enough

        not even from an old pro

    DRAPER: cop corroboration of info in informants' tip validates

        specificity counts
        accuracy of prediction counts
        innocence of corroborated conduct matters
        track record of the informant matters
        anonymity matters

        Still good law under totality of the circumstances test

    SPINELLI: two prong test introduced (abandoned in GATES)

        -Veracity/Reliability
            established by corroboration (Draper factors)
        -Basis of Knowledge
            established by corroboration
            specific to future events
            intimacy between suspect and rat

        some states still use this
        states can have a higher standard
        fed con crim law sets the floor

    GATES: IL-FL drug run case

        abandons SPINELLI std and adopts "totality of the circumstances"
        anonymous tip affords little basis of knowledge
            but it did predict a lot of future behavior that was later corroborated
            this is different from DRAPER because we don't know the informant

        no more technical standard

    ORNELAS: PROBABLE CAUSE is review DE NOVO on appeal in warrantless searches

        this is not true de novo review though

            they review facts only for clear error
            and they give "due weight" to officers and district court
            which locks in the crap and leaves no room for meaningful review

        more deferential is employed in review of warrant searches

        F: CA plates on a "drug dealer" car with a loose panel

    HARRIS: a certified dog has a presumption that its alerts provide PC

        D can still argue on the dog's shitty record
            but you're gonna cary the burden, and where do you get the info
            plus hindsight bias

Day 7
2/3/2016

    RULE:  What the officer knows has to be written out in the warrant

    PC factors for tips:  innocence of conduct, corroboration by cops, accurate prediction

    HERE STARTS THE WARRANT EXCEPTIONS SECTION

    The EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES exception to the warrant "requirement"

        four key questions:

            -when does the exigency expire? (MINCEY)
            -are the suspects fleeing? (WARDEN)
            -is destruction of evidence possible?
                THREE ABOVE REQUIRE PC, THE ONE BELOW DOES NOT
            [-are the cops engaging in community caretaking?]

            RULE: cops must have probable cause to search, and the exigency prevents the option of seeking a warrant

    MINCEY

        RULE: a limited amount of unwarranted searching is permissible at a homicide scene in order to secure the safety of possible victims and officers.  you can detain and grab weapons

            the push in the first ten minutes and then poking around that follows is where we draw the line

            four days of searching cannot be justified by the exigency

        RULE: a warrantless search must be strictly circumscribed by the exigencies which justify its initiation

        cite this case to support a warrant preference model

    WARDEN

        BUIE:  you're allowed to do a sweep of the house

        RULE:  cops in hot pursuit can follow a fleeing felony suspect into a house and conduct a limited search there

        speed is essential, and safety plus evidence are key

    WELSH

        WARDEN does not control here because welsh was not a felon, and the pursuit was not hot.  The gov's best argument would be destruction fo evidence through metabolism

        RULE: the hot pursuit exception to the warrant requirement does not extend to cool pursuit

        RULE: the severity of the offense helps to determine whether there's an exigency

    ELKINS

        cops see a pot plant through a hole in a wall, then detain a person outside the building, and then saw a guy aware of the cops go into the building

        this gives them reason to believe that evidence would be destroyed

        they had PC to believe he had pot in the building

        RULE:  cops can enter to search even if they were partly responsible for creating the exignecy

    JOHNSON

        cops hang outside a door and listen, the door opens

        the cops lies about what he had seen inside the apartment

        therefore the court recognized no PC

    KY v KING

        undercover cop making a drug buy.  they follow him to a two-apartment fork.  they smell pot under one door.  they choose that door, but they're wrong

        they knock and yell police (think JARDINES), they enter when they hear shuffling

            [knock and announce is a warrant procedure, knock and talk is a warrantless PC procedure]

        I: whether they created the exigency that allowed them to go into the apartment and in turn, whether that is a legit exigent circumstances exception candidate

        RULE:  where the police did not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to engage in conduct that violates the 4thA, warrantless entry to prevent the destruction of evidence is reasonable and thus allowed

            Police-created exigencies are no deal breaker.
            Exigent circumstances without PC are not sufficient.

            In order to satisfy the exigent circumstances requirement, you need EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES and PROBABLE CAUSE.

            Exam Process:

                Q1: PC?
                Q2: Exigent Circumstances?

                    -eg, hot pursuit, risk of destruction of evidence
                    -police-created exigency == okay
                    -exigencies expire

        objective reasonability is the key

            the subjective intent of the cops does not matter

            bad faith by cops is no deal breaker because its so hard to prove the bad faith

Day 8
2/8/2016

    WELSH:  exigent circumstance analysis affected by seriousness of the crime

        but no blanket rules, even for homicide

    STANTON:  hot pursuit trumps seriousness of crime analysis.  hot pursuit == exigency

    MCNEELY:  no categorical rule allowing warrantless blood tests bc telephones exist

    EXIGENCY ANALYSIS:  consider also

        the amount of time needed to get a warrant

        and the seriousness of the offense

    ROHRIG:  community caretaking model allows mere reasonable suspicion to justify entry

        once the cops find a way in, remember to ask about the scope of the permissible search

    STUART: cops observed a "fracas."

        RULE: Cops may enter a home without a warrant

            -to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or
            -to protect an occupant from imminent injury

        arguments made against letting cops enter under a community caretaking model, but with an intent to make arrests (under the criminal investigation model)

    RYBURN: rumor about kid shooting up the school

        FACTS:

            no PC based on info going in, but then the mom responds weirdly

            still no PC, even with all the suspicious facts

            under traditional criminal model, the police cannot enter the house

            but the cumulative weight of the facts allow the cops to infer that someone might be in danger in the house

        Reasoning:

            therefore, under the community caretaking model, and with concern for officer safety

            it was reasonable for the cops to go inside, according to the court

        RULE:  cops can readily enter a house under the community caretaking model

    EXAM STRATEGY:  make a list of fact chunks, and attach a group of cases to each

    ABOVE:  EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES
    BELOW:  PLAIN VIEW EXCEPTION

    THE PLAIN VIEW EXCEPTION APPLIES TO SEIZURES

        seizures of objects found during a search, that is

        it allows cops to seize evidence of a crime found on a search without having to go get a warrant specifically for the seizure

        RULE:  Police may seize contraband or evidence of a crime where

            -object is in plain view
            -cop is legally authorized to be there
            -cop can take physical control of the item from where he is
            -object's contraband nature is "immediately apparent"

    CLASS:  VIN case

        cops searching for VIN see a gun

        Looking through the window standing next to the car does not require plain view doctrine.  It's not even a search.

        the first issue is where he opens the door and shuffles the papers

            -is there a [4thA] search?
                no, because no REOP in VIN
            -did it violate the 4th?
                no, we don't even get to this question
            -what is the remedy?
                none, that guy is on the hook for the gun

            *after jones or jardines this might come out differently

        the second issue is where he seizes the gun

            -there is a seizure
            -but plain view doctrine permits the seizure, so no violation

                plain view
                cop is authorized to be there
                cop can legally take control of the item from where he is
                contraband nature is apparent

            -no remedy bc no violation

    HICKS:  fancy stereos in crappy apartment

        LOTS OF USEFUL RULES IN THIS CASE

        cop had to touch and move the stereo in order to get the serial number

        PLAIN VIEW ANALYSIS:

            1&2- they're in the apt w/o a warrant, under the exigent circumstances exception

            3&4- but the serial number is on the bottom, and no PC that it's evidence of a crime or that it's contraband

            the fondling goes too far

    HORTON: inadvertence is not necessary to a plain-view seizure

    ABOVE: PLAIN VIEW
    BELOW: AUTOMOBILES

    CARROLL:  gives us the automobile exception to the warrant requirement

        cars are easily moved, this means there's an exigency argument
        cars are easily moved, this means evidence is vulnerable to destruction
        cars go on the road and are subject to pervasive regulations, so no REOP

        KEY RULE: if you have PC THAT THERE'S EVIDENCE OF A CRIME IN A CAR, cops can stop and search it without a warrant

Day 9
2/10/2016

    CHADWICK: container-out-of-car case

        RULE: more REOP in footlocker than car

        they can seize container with PC, but they'd need a warrant to open it

    ROSS: whole car and containers within can be searched if they have PC for car

    ACEVEDO:

        KEY RULE: if they have PC for the car they can search an automobile and all containers within it

        RULE:  if they have PC to search for the container, they can search the car until they find the container, and they can open the container

            *Finding contraband in the course of a search for a particular container may generate PC for the rest of the container/car.

    CARNEY:  reduced EOP in a mobile home

        RULE: cops can search a mobile home w/o a warrant if they have PC

        *if it's on blocks, it might be treated more like a home
        *if it's on wheels, the car rules apply

    HOUGHTON:  purse in car case

        RULE: cops with PC to search a car may search passengers' belongings found in the car that are capable of concealing the object of the search

        DI RE RULE: PC to search a car does not justify a body search of passenger
        YBARRA RULE: warrant for tavern and bartender does not permit body searches of patrons

    ARRESTS SECTIONS

        you need PC to believe that a person committed a particular crime to arrest

    AWADALLAH: material witness arrests

        cops may arrest a person who they have PC to think has material information on an ongiong grand jury investigation

    WATSON:

        RULE: 4thA doesn't require a warrant for felony arrests in public

        RULE: 4thA doesn't require a warrant for misdemeanor arrests where the offense was committed in the officer's presence

        RULE: arrestee is entitled to ex post magistrate review within 48 hours

    PAYTON: arrests in suspect's home

        RULE: warrantless entry into private home for the purpose of arrest no permitted

        RULE: arrest warrant req to enter, but no search warrant req

    STEAGALD: arrests in 3rd party home

        RULE: search warrant to enter home is req to preserve 3rd party rights

        Arrests in a public space of an apartment building req no warrant.
        Arrests in your apartment req warrant.
        Arrests on your threshold may req no warrant.
        Arrests on your porch req no warrant.

    ATWATER: seatbelt arrest case

        RULE: cops may make a custodial arrest for first-time, fine-only misdemeanors

Day 10
2/15/2016

    ATWATER CONT:

        this is easy for cops to follow, but it authorizes brutal and senseless humiliation

        VA v Moore:

            Moore's argument:

                the state law already provided a bright line for this similar situation

            Court:

                cops can take suspects into custody even when it violates state law

    FLORENCE: guy mistakenly brought in on a minor offense

        RULE:  everyone who comes into the jail gets the same treatment, though

        This case is an example of the brutal consequences of Atwater and Moore.

    SEARCHES INCIDENT TO ARREST START HERE

        where does the exception come from?
        how far does it go?
        what can they search?

        SITLA (Search Incident To Lawful Arrest) rationales:

            -officer safety

                this would permit a pat-down/cursory search of the suspect and the immediately surrounding area

                it would also permit a sweep of a home if the arrest takes place in the home

            -evidence

                prevention of destruction of evidence (this is an exigency arg, expires)

                    this would permit searches of the area that the unsecured suspect could affect

                evidence gathering

    CHIMEL: coin shop burglary search of house.  they arrested him at home.

        under the old stds of Harris and Rabinowitz, in practice this would have been constitutionally permissible

        the court overturns

        RULE:  search is now limited to places where arrestee might access weapons or destroy evidence

        CHIMEL defines a searchable "grab area" measured at the time of arrest

        the MAJ redefines the rationales for the search (less about evidence gathering and more about prevention of destruction of evidence)

        The MAJ narrows the scope of what can be lawfully searched incident to arrest

    ROBINSON:  traffic stop, crumpled cigarettes, 14 capsules of heroin

        RULE: no 'reason to believe joe was armed' req for a cop to search an arrestee

        no need to show that arrestee was dangerous, search entitlement is automatic

        cop can go through EVERYTHING in the wallet they pull out of your pocket

            also your journal, or your cigarette pack, etc

    KNOWLES:  if you're not taking suspect into custody, no search incident to arrest

    RILEY:  smartphone search case

        pairs with WURIE, which is the flip phone case

        All the intrusions up to and including the point of the search of his pockets are permissible

        But the question is whether they can poke around through the phone

        Gov argues to apply Robinson directly, and then makes CHIMEL arguments
            (safety of officers/destruction of evidence arguments[auto-wiping])

            BUT data is not dangerous
            AND exigent circumstances doctrine would permit a search if they actually believed there was a geo-fencing/remote wiping threat.  Also cops can use Farraday bags to exert control

                this would require some kind of showing of suspicion
                this is no longer a ROBINSON automatic search situation

            SO

        ROBERTS MAJ: smart phones are fucking different from the crap you keep in your wallets and pockets

            he's more of a reasonableness justice

            but this is a warrant type case.  it's a std criminal investigation.

                normal info gathering means we use the warrant preference model

        RULE: a warrant is generally required before such a search, even when a cell phone is seized incident to arrest

    BUIE: protective sweep case

        RULE:

            when conducting a "protective sweep" of a house
            where cops are executing an arrest warrant,
            cops need an articulable suspicion [==RS]
            that areas swept harbor an individual posing a danger.

            It may extend only to a cursory inspection
            of those spaces where a person may be found

        also, as a chimel search, you need no PC or RS to look in the closets in the room where the suspect is arrested

            [opening closets is automatically permitted under CHIMEL]
            [you need RS to go into other rooms in the house]

    BELTON: DO NOT CITE, USE GANT INSTEAD

        searches incident to arrest in cars typically follow a pattern:

            arrest a suspect
            put him in cuffs in the back of the cop car
            search the car

        this expanded the SITLA exception significantly, and unhinged it from its justifications

        the automatic car search after arrest was too far for the ct

        THORNTON expanded BELTON by permitting cops to search cars even after the suspect had left the car voluntarily

Day 11
2/17/2016

    Make a car card:

        all the possible ways to search a car

    ROBINSON RULE: cops get a free search incident to arrest automatically, no PC no RS req

        they can search you and your pockets and your purse but not your locked briefcase

    RULE:  as long as you have regular inventory procedures, you can inventory search

    GANT: suspended license cocaine case.  CRITICAL CASE! EXAM

        RULE:

            for cops to search car incident to arrest, D must have been in position to reach area searched (rooted in CHIMEL) [limited to passenger area]

            OR

            cops must have "reason to believe" evidence related to crime of arrest will be located there (rooted in SCALIA'S THORNTON dissent) [limited to passenger area]

                The search must be limited to the grab area of the suspect during THE TIME OF THE SEARCH

        "reason to believe"

            requires some level of suspicion, something like reasonable suspicion
            has to be about the offense, think atwater and picasso

    THIS IS WHERE WE TRANSITION FROM THE WARRANT MODEL AND ITS EXCEPTIONS TO THE REASONABLENESS MODEL

        All the warrant exception cases involve at least some suspicion
        What follows will be suspicionless searches

        where to break out reasonableness:

            administrative searches
            government inspectors (who are not invesitagting cops)

        key distinction: purpose of the search

            criminal investigation falls into the warrant model (trad cop snooping)
            administrative searches fall into the reasonableness model

    BERTINE: DUI van inventory case

        RULE:

            police may inventory a vehicle they impound incident to arrest
            as long as they use "REGULAR PROCEDURES"

    INVENTORY SEARCHES:

        no suspicion required
        regular procedures required
        purposes:

            protect owners' property rights
            protect cops

                these purposes don't have to be established though

            the point ostensibly is not to advance an investigation
            but cops can use everything they find in a prosecution

    CAMARA and SEE:  regulatory search cases

        Step One:  Is there a search?

            Yes.  There's a government actor poking around.

        Step Two: Did it comply with the reqs of the 4thA?

            As long as they COMPLY with their REASONABLE STANDARD SEARCH PROCEDURES, it's reaosnable.

        Step Three:  We don't reach this, there's no remedy where there's no violation.

    TERRY:  stop and frisk case

        FACTS:  40yr cop watches a few guys casing a store.  Stops them, grabs them, frisks them, orders them into the store, and shakes them down, seizing weapons

            he supposes he has reaonsable suspicion that they're contemplating a theft
                [cops don't always have to specify the crime they suspect]
            and suspects that they may have weapons

        ANALYSIS:

            1- Is there a 4thA event here?

                STOP==SEIZURE?

                    were they free to leave the encounter? no.
                    were they free to not answer his questions? no.

                    YES!

                        a stop is a 4thA seizure

                FRISK==SEARCH?

                    YES!

                        a frisk is a 4thA search

            2- If yes, did the search or seizure comply with the reqs of the 4thA?

                Does the stop and the frisk comply with the warrant model? no.
                Does it count as unreasonable under the 4thA? no.

                    They use reasonableness to try to find some middle ground in the 4thA

                    He had suspicion based on facts and rational inferences.

                        he articulates facts (pacing, failure to answer)
                        and his experience apparently allows him to infer from there

                for a STOP, you need "REASONABLE SUSPICION" that the suspect is contemplating a crime/ "criminal activity is afoot"

                STOP is justified by Reasonable Suspicion that criminal activity is afoot

                FRISK is justified by Reasonable Suspicion that the suspect is armed

            3- If no, what is the remedy?

        The stop is about investigating and finding evidence of criminal activity
        The frisk is about officer safety

            but, that which the cops uncover while search for safety's sake is admissible

        What is the scope of a Terry stop?

        RULE: Handcuffs are a factor, but not dispositive.  they suggest arrest.

Day 12
2/23/2016

    EXAM:  as a catch-all at the end of any analysis, mention that the cops can inventory

    STOPS AND FRISKS

    DUNAWAY

        murder suspect taken into custody without probable cause

            cops will want to say this was only a stop
            suspect will want to say this went into arrest territory

        physically restrained, made incriminating statements

        Key fact:  the suspect was taken from one place and moved to another

        RULE: a stop is more likely an arrest if the suspect is substantially moved

            stepping out of the street, stepping into the hallway does not suffice
            moving to a different building counts as a substantial move

    ROYER

        airport drug case, suspect moved to an interrogation room 40ft away, 15min passes

        these facts about relocation and time push this over the line from stop to arrest

        RULE: a stop is more likely an arrest if 20min passes or if spooky room

    MIMMS

        cop orders a suspect out of his car
        frisks him and finds a gun

        issue:  whether ordering him out of the car makes this an arrest

        Holding: nah, that's just fine bc officer safety

        RULE: where officer safety is implicated, we have no 4thA rights

        GENERAL RULE: a traffic stop is treated like a Terry stop

            even though they have PC that a traffic infraction happened

    JOHNSON

        license plate stop in a gang neighborhood
        no reason to suspect anyone was involved with gang activity
        guy looks at cops and possesses a scanner
        cops order him out of the car and find a gun

        they have PC to stop the car on a traffic stop

        cops can order the driver and the passengers out of the car

        issue: was there RS for the frisk?

        holding: the cops had RS that he was armed, based on the list of factors

        D's argument: there is no RS for this stop or frisk based on this D

            the stop was about registration, not gang activity

        RULE: cops can frisk even when the frisk is unreated to the purpose of the stop

    SHARPE

        RULE: there's no fixed time restriction for Terry stops

        20min of stoppage was hunky dory in the ct's view

    RODRIGUEZ

        dog sniff extends the length of the stop.  the traffic stop had ended, and the 7 minute extension of the stop (where he was not free to leave) was unlawful

        RULE: authority for the seizure ends when the tasks tied to the traffic infraction are--or reasonably should have been--completed

            does the suspect feel free to leave?

    WARDLOW

        guy holding a bag at noon runs from police

        issue:  whether flight from police is sufficient to establish RS

        the court brings up a bunch of other supporting factors

            -they assert unsupported that its a high crime neighborhood
            -eye contact, then flight

        RULE:  if you can layer other factors onto flight, you can claim RS

        flight and other factors can be considered into RS analysis

    LONG

        RULE: cops can "frisk" your car

            open hand touching for weapons bc safety is permissible
            groping and manipulating is not

                if you feel something that feels like contraband
                you can invoke the "plain feel" doctrine

    DICKERSON

        RULE: pat down for weapons is ok, patdown for drugs is not

            but if you find drugs while patting for weapons, admissible

    ARVIZU

        minivan on the border with weird waving kids in the back

        the factors taken together are enough to make an officer reasonably suspicious

            RS of drug smuggling

    HIBBLE

        cop can req you to identify yourself

Day 13
Leap Day 2016

    WHITE:

        accurate predictive anonymous tip corroborated by cops

        there was sufficient indicia of reliability

        this is probably the minimum of what RS requires

            RS: lower std, can rely on informants, less demanding, totality of the circumstances, can consider innocent factors

    FL v JL

        there's a tip involving the race, shirt, and an allegation that suspect is holding a gun

        but there's no predictive power in this tip

        it suggests this tipster has no intimate knowledge of the suspect's patterns

        RULE: a bare, anonymous and unpredictive tip is not sufficient for RS for a stop and frisk

            no firearm exception
            but maybe a bomb exception in national security/terrorism

    NAVARETTE

        bare tip on a silver F150 about a traffic violation

        they pull the truck over, and find a lot of pot

        Thomas v Scalia discussion

        court conducts an analysis of factors that cut in favor of reliability

            its almost predictive
            its kind of not anonymous

        they conclude RS of driving drunk
        but actually they have RS of reckless driving

            but the court allows an inference from reckless driving to drunk driving

            this is necessary bc otherwise there's no ongoing offense

                the reckless driving is done with, but the drunkenness is not

        RULE: an anonymous tip to 911 announcing a single instance of reckless driving, along with the location of the car, will support a traffic stop

    HEIEN

        brake light is out, cop stops, searches car, finds cocaine

        was there RS for the stop?

            D: no, driver had a stop lamp working. legal in NC.  cop made a mistake of law

            CT: cop made a reasonable mistake of law, its permissible

        RULE: cop can make a stop based on [otherwise] RS grounded in a mistake of law

        they claim that this is an objective standard

    PROFILING

        cops can use profiles to build RS or PC, see arvizu
        the more discretion a cop has in this context, the more likely he will include race

        RACE

            DOJ guidelines say you can use race

                to filter suspects when you have a description
                to pursue national security

    SOKOLOW

        cops use a drug courier profile

            paid in cash for airline tickets
            name did not match telephone
            destination was Miami
            short trip duration
            he appeared nervous
            didn't check bags

        the factors from the profile hold up. they generate RS

        the fact they were in a profile, they ignore more or less

            no ruling on yes or no for profiles, really

    WHREN

        pretextual stops case

        Suspicion factors:

            high drug area
            temporary license plates
            young people
            distracted driver
            suspiciously long stop at stop sign
            car sped away

        cops stop him, see cocaine in the lap of the passenger

        the cops stop him for the traffic violations [and for his race, argues WHREN]

        the court "declines to look into the subjective intent of the officers"

            they say there was an objective reason for the stop, and that flies

            they dismiss the claim as not a 4thA issue, but rather a EP issue

        there's not just a blind claim of pretext.
        the manual prohibits plainclothes cops from making traffic stops except where danger

    AL KIDD

        guy is held in a maximum-security prison as a material witness to 9/11 insider info
        they really detained him bc they suspected him of terrorism
        the material witness detention is a pretext

        to prevail, the court would have to look at the subjective intent
        otherwise, the detention survives as objectively reasonable

        you just apply the material witness statute

            pc to beleive person has info relevant to an ongoing grand jury investigation
            impracticable to secure their presence in ct by subpoena

Day 14
03/02/2016

    AL KIDD

        detainee sues AG for his allegedly illegitimate detention

        he's trying to get at the programmatic purpose of the detention program

        they use a material witness detention statute as a pretext for detaining him

        the affidavit for his warrant contained misrepresentations

            they made him out to look like a flight risk
            but he really was probably not

    SPECIAL NEEDS DOCTRINE

        EXAM analysis:

            1- has the gov articulated a special [regulatory] need beyond traitional law enforcement? [investigation, evidence-gathering]
            2- Three-part breakdown:
                what is the the government interest?
                how effective is the fit between the program and its goal?
                how significant is the intrusion on personal liberty?

        Border Searches

        Inventory Searches

            no PC req except for the PC needed for the predicate arrest

            only req is standard procedures

        Admin Searches

            do not need pc
            do not need RS
            reasonable admin scheme is sufficient

        Jail Searches

        BORDER SEARCHES

            MARTINEZ FUERTE

                suspicionless border checkpoint searches are permissible
                you can even disassemble a gas tank at the border (flores-montano)

            RS req if significantly more intrusive (montoya de hernandez)
                16 hour detention at border on RS

            roving patrols
                stop and frisk car RS
                search car PC

        PROUSE and SITZ

            both sobriety checkpoints
            req: constrain officer discretion with REGULARIZED PROCEDURES
            key distinction: is the purpose DETERRENCE or CATCHING criminals?

Day 15
03/07/2016

    EDMOND

        drug checkpoint case
        by this point, a sobriety checkpoint is ok as long as the purpose is deterrence
            [regulatory is ok, catching drunks is not]
        this is a no go bc trad law enforcement purpose

    LIDSTER

        cops are trying to find info on a hit-and-run
        checkpoint stop is short, involves only a few questions
        they're looking for witnesses
        and handing out fliers

        Analysis:

            Step One:

                Has the gov articulated a [regulatory] SPECIAL NEED beyond traditional law enforcement?

                    the court IDs a special need here bc they're looking for help from the public

                    they're not looking for the suspect, they're looking for witnesses

            Step Two:

                HOW IMPORTANT is the interest?

                    the court would say this is a serious crime investigation, strong interest

                how well does the stop advance the purpose? FIT

                    same time and same place as hit and run, so ct sees good fit

                how strong is the degree of the INDIVIDUAL'S LIBERTY INTEREST?

                    court minimizes this.  not intrusive, not asking them to get out.

    SCHOOL CASES

        no need to establish a problem with the subgroup you want to test

    EARLS

        suspicionless drug-test of students in extra-curricular programs is permissible

    TLO

        probably RS is req for a search of any given student


    SAFFORD

        age, sex, seriousness of crime, and intrusiveness all factor in
        the strip search is too much even with RS

    DRUG TESTING CASES

    VON RAAB

        gov interest in separating drug enforcement officers and drug consumer
        justifies drug test
        as a condition of employment

    SKINNER

        drug test for rail employees in accident or safety rules situations ok

    CHANDLER

        drug testing for candidates for public office
        they fail to establish a problem with the subgroup they want to test
        the system doesnt even work that well, it's an easy system to game

    FERGUSON

        there was a search
            bc the testing was performed by a gov actor
            bc there's a urine sample handed to a nurse and then to law enforcement
                C/A: analogize to greenwood and to hoffa and the informant cases
        it did not comply with the req of the 4th
            bc it didnt hold up under the special needs analysis

            special need would be public health

                but the short term means are traditional law enforcement

    MARYLAND v KING

        DNA sampling case

        there was a search

            two actually:
            the cheek swab (hicks jones TRESPASS onto the person, REOP squeeze cases)
            the search of his DNA once it's in the db

        compliance with warrant

            no warrant, no warrant exception
            not a special needs case bc trad law enforcement purpose
            therefore this is a totality of the circumstances / reasonableness case

                which plays just like the special needs analysis, except without step one

            BALANCING THE INTERESTS

                gov has interests:

                    -ID those in custody
                        (though this is BS bc delays and db is full of unsolved cases)
                    -SECURITY of the facility, cite florence
                        (fails for similar reasons)
                    -availability for trial: FLIGHT RISK and bail setting
                    -dangerousness inquiry in BAIL DETERMINATION
                    -EXONERATING the wrongly convicted

                fit analysis:

                    objections above undercut fit
                    the delays are the big problem
                    MAJ upholds for the following reasons:

                        -this is 21stC version of fingerprinting
                        -this is terrifically ACCURATE
                        -the process is LIMITED:
                            tested (published) population is limited to those convicted
                            judge reviews
                            limited to violent offenders
                            limited to DNA that IDs and not DNA that speaks to health

                privcy interest:

                    cheek swab minimally invasive physically, says ct
                    the search only IDs person, not facts of person's health
                    arrestee has a reduced EOP

Day 16
03/21/2016

    Maryland v King

        is not really a special needs case bc the gov cannot articulate a need beyond traditional law enforcement investigation

        Maj skips the special need part of the special needs analysis

        jumps right into balancing interests

            Gov interests:

                ID
                safety
                discouraging flight
                bail determination
                exoneration

            fit:

                accuracy of DNA
                limited population

            individual's interest:

                minimal physical intrusion
                diminished expectation of privacy
                processing/retention of DNA reasonable

        this case is similar to special needs but is not one bc they articulated no special need

            maybe its more like the probationer/parolee cases

    SAMSON

        cops stop him, dispel initial suspicion for stop, cops search him anyhow

        RULE: cops can stop and search a parolee without warrant or suspicion of wrongdoing

            they have a REDUCED EOP and that affects the reasonableness analysis, but it is still a search

            a parolee is finishing his sentence while released (here)
            a probationer is being supervised instead of a sentence

            first case where a cop can make a suspicionless search without any of the regular procedures that normaly constrain suspicionless searches

            this is another totality of the circumstances case

             police, suspicionless, totality

        GRIFFIN

            probation case
            discussed within samson

            it's a special needs case

            there's an interest in supervising the probationer's reintegration into society
            the probation officer does the search in this case
            RS

            probation officers, RS, Special needs

        KNIGHTS

            probation case
            discussed within samson

            not a special needs case

            search is done by cops
            totality of the circumstances
            RS

            police, RS, totality

            PROBATIONERS:

                reduced liberty expectation
                reduced expectation of privacy

        Analysis:

            important gov interest:

                overwhelming interest in supervising risky population
                reintegration
                eliminating recitivism

            fit:

                limited to risky populations
                evidence of impact on recitivism

            intrusion on individual interest:

                probationers-diminished
                parolees-severely diminished
                both have notice of the search condition of release

    POLICE USE OF FORCE

        generally a fact-bound inquiry, very murky
        no bright line rules
        these are hard for cops to evaluate
            court is reluctant to second-guess

    TENNESSEE v GARNER

        kid burglary suspect fleeing cops gets shot in the back of the head

        RULE: a cop can use deadly force only if it is necessary to prevent the escape of a suspect that poses a significant threat of death or serious harm. cop must have PC

            old common law rule: cop can use deadly force to stop a fleeing felon

            but jdxs and PDs both have prohibited it
            bc the law makes so many things felonies that were not felonies under the CL

        merely trying to prevent the escape of a suspect is not enough

        EXAM prep: add the factors here

    SCOTT v HARRIS

        high speed chase, cop rams the fleeing suspect, cripples him permanently

        RULE: a cop may ram a fleeing suspect if the chase is dangerous

        maj balances risk to suspect v risk to cops and others

        they don't use the factors from GARNER

        analysis:

            is the suspect armed or dangerous? yes. driving fast in the rain.
            severity of crime? he was guilty of speeding, but escalated bumping and jiving

            on sum, the conduct was not "clearly unreasonable under established precedent"

                therefore no 1983 violation

    GRAHAM v CONNOR

        diabetic guy runs in and out of a shop in search of OJ
        cop stops him because he doesn't like the look
        then they beat him up, determine his innocence, and take him home

        totality of the circumstances reasonablness is the std for excessive force

            facts of the case
            severity of the crime
            threat to safety
            resisting arrest
            attempt to flee
            proportionality of the force given the situation

    CONSENT CASES

        consent is cheap
        knowledge of right to refuse is irrelevant
        it only needs to be voluntary
        not knowing and intelligent

        consent must be voluntary
        waiver must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent

    SCHNECKLOTH v BUSTAMONTE

        RULE: a prosecutor must prove that consent was voluntary

        so, how do we define vountary?

            not as knowing
            not connected to being advised of right to refuse

            knowledge can be relevant to the totality-type analysis
                but it is not dispositive

        holding applies when:

            not in custody
            search was consented to
            voluntariness std met:

                state has burden
