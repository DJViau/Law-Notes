Day 1
1/13/16

    Intro:

            Gouldin:  Don't transcribe the class

            This is the cops-and-robbers course
            Con Crim Adj is the bail-to-jail

            No statutory law in this course, lots and lots of cases

        System Actors:

            Prosecutors- bring charges and decide which to bring, plea deals (+95%)

            Defense- 5th and 6th amendment rights to counsel

            Police/Investigator- make arrests, gather info/conduct searches, interrogation, decide which crimes to investigate, preventative/regulatory harrassment

            Legislators- define crimes and define sentence ranges, lots of things are criminal

            Judges- issue warrants, admit evidence, drive sentencing

            Grand Jury- formal charging

            Informants!

        Themes:

            Gap between ideal and actual system

                assmebly line/crime control v. obstacle course/due process

            Relationship between procedural requirements and underlying offense

            Practical/Strategic application of procedural requirements

            Impacts of technology

            The difficulty of reconciling system goals

                accuracy (truth-seeking function)
                privacy
                liberty (limited gov)
                security (impact of 9/11 realigned priorities)
                efficiency (resource constraints)
                fairness (discretion, racial disparities)

        The FOURTH AMENDMENT

            4thA is divided into reasonableness clause and warrant clause

                a warrant means the search or seizure is reasonable

            it protects the right of "the people"

                that is, US people.  not US citizens overseas, not foreigners, maybe illegals

            it "protects" against the government

            what counts as unreasonable is the inquiry of this course

            "seizures" include people and stuff

            "shall not be violated" is silent on remedies


Days 2 & 3
1/20/16

    What is the purpose of the 4th amendment?

        -protecting individual privacy
        -regulating the police

    What questions are answered by Katz?

        -WAS THERE A SEARCH?

            [this is a key question.  first question in every case]

        -DID THE SEARCH COMPLY WITH THE 4TH?

            they would have needed a warrant back then
            otherwise, it would have needed to have been "reasonable"

        -WHAT IS THE REMEDY?

            exclusionary rule to suppress

    KATZ

        KATZ gives us the "reasonable expectation of privacy" approach

        bookie in a phone booth.  gov places a bug on the outside of the booth.

        OLMSTEAD had said that there had to be a trespass, KATZ overturned that

        HOLDING:  in katz's favor bc the gov's warrantless search violated his privacy

        "the 4th amendment protects people, not places"

        outcome:  evidence suppressed

        REOP = Reasonable Expectation of Privacy

        TEST: Harlan's concurrence

            -subjective (actual) expectation of privacy
            -reasonable/legitimate expectation of privacy

    HESTER

        p370

        bootlegger caught selling whiskey, cops had trespassed onto his property and observed from 100 yards

        rule: the 4th amendment rights do not apply to open fields

        the curtilage is the area surrounding the house

    OLIVER

        guy growing pot, cops walk a mile onto his property, passing no trespassing signs

        HOLDING:  not a search, never REOP in "open fields"

        fields aren't sacred private spaces

        OPEN FIELDS: area outside curtilage

            "An open field need be neither 'open' nor a 'field'"

    DUNN

        CURTILAGE:

            -distance from house
            -presence of enclosure
            -nature of use of area
            -steps taken to protect the area form observation

        cops walk onto a property and peek into a barn

    CIRAOLO/RILEY

        p372

        cops flying over and observing from above

        C: 1000 ft in a plane
        R: 400 ft in a helicopter

        both observed pot plants

        Was this a search?

            3 approaches:

                -commercial flight traffic is common today, no REOP
                -cops didn't violate FAA regs therefore public coulda been there, no REOP
                -who has the burden of proving amount of air traffic?

    BOND

        p376

        border patrol feels up a bag while checking on immigration status, he finds a brick

        squeezing the bag goes beyond what you expect to happen to your bag on a bus

        [sometimes consent is enough, but here he got consent based on an initial search]

        the touch/squeeze difference is hard to determine, and easily manipulated by cops

    HOFFA

        4th does not protect your trust interest in a colleague who is actually a narc

        if you tell somebody something, you have no privacy interest in it

        this case relies on the recollection of the guy who was there

    WHITE

        whether the 4th bars testimony betwen white and an informant where the conversation was heard via electronic bug

        the informant was not available to testify, so this case relies on a wire recording

        he had an actual but not a reasonable expectation of privacy

        R: you lose control of the info you share with another person

        POLICY: this rule suppresses authentic natural daily interactions

            but there are some crimes you couldn't police without these tools

    MILLER/SMITH

        3rd party doctrine cases

    GREENWOOD

        do you have a REOP in your trash?

        if you do, then it's a search for them to root through it

        the court says no, you have no REOP

            bc "we can't expect the police to avert their eyes" from that which is in public

                but it's in an opaque bag

                    c/a but any kid, snoop, or animal could have strewn it about

                but there's a reg that requires residents to place the trash on the curb weekly

                    c/a you're handing it to a 3rd party

                        c/c/a but it gets intermingled with other trash

    DOW CHEMICAL

        aerial snooping over a chemical plant is ok bc it's a regulated commercial facility

        they used enhanced photography

    KYLLO

        the court finds a search where the cops had used a thermal camera to detect the thermal signature of a pot growing operation

        TEST:  how prevalent and available is the technology used?

        it's a search because of the uncommon method used and it's not limited to observing things outside the home.

        HOME HAS SPECIAL PROTECTION UNDER THE 4TH AMENDMENT

    KNOTTS

        ether beeper case 1

        no 4th violation bc no REOP in your movements

        the tech is the issue here, and they lose on that

    KARO

        ether beeper case 2

        key difference:  this beeper goes inside several different homes

        the wholesale acceptance of a bugged barrel is the hangup here

        part of your property rights include a right to not have a bug in your drum

        so maybe this is a seizure

    JONES

        "this upends 4th amendment jurisprudence"

        GPS bug placed on D's car

        Scalia sees the trespass as enought to qualify the bug as a 4th amendment event

            revives the Olmstead view

        two technical problems complicate things

            day 11 on a ten day warrant
            in wrong jdx

        HOLDING: GPS bug is a search bc it's a trespass and they have intent to gather info

            this test is added to KATZ now

        ALITO:  the tech is cheap, so no kyllo issue. 4 weeks of snooping is too much
