Day 1
1/13/16

    Intro:

            Gouldin:  Don't transcribe the class

            This is the cops-and-robbers course
            Con Crim Adj is the bail-to-jail

            No statutory law in this course, lots and lots of cases

        System Actors:

            Prosecutors- bring charges and decide which to bring, plea deals (+95%)

            Defense- 5th and 6th amendment rights to counsel

            Police/Investigator- make arrests, gather info/conduct searches, interrogation, decide which crimes to investigate, preventative/regulatory harrassment

            Legislators- define crimes and define sentence ranges, lots of things are criminal

            Judges- issue warrants, admit evidence, drive sentencing

            Grand Jury- formal charging

            Informants!

        Themes:

            Gap between ideal and actual system

                assmebly line/crime control v. obstacle course/due process

            Relationship between procedural requirements and underlying offense

            Practical/Strategic application of procedural requirements

            Impacts of technology

            The difficulty of reconciling system goals

                accuracy (truth-seeking function)
                privacy
                liberty (limited gov)
                security (impact of 9/11 realigned priorities)
                efficiency (resource constraints)
                fairness (discretion, racial disparities)

        The FOURTH AMENDMENT

            4thA is divided into reasonableness clause and warrant clause

                a warrant means the search or seizure is reasonable

            it protects the right of "the people"

                that is, US people.  not US citizens overseas, not foreigners, maybe illegals

            it "protects" against the government

            what counts as unreasonable is the inquiry of this course

            "seizures" include people and stuff

            "shall not be violated" is silent on remedies


Days 2 & 3
1/20/16

    What is the purpose of the 4th amendment?

        -protecting individual privacy
        -regulating the police

    What questions are answered by Katz?

        -WAS THERE A SEARCH?

            [this is a key question.  first question in every case]

        -DID THE SEARCH COMPLY WITH THE 4TH?

            they would have needed a warrant back then
            otherwise, it would have needed to have been "reasonable"

        -WHAT IS THE REMEDY?

            exclusionary rule to suppress

    KATZ

        KATZ gives us the "reasonable expectation of privacy" approach

        bookie in a phone booth.  gov places a bug on the outside of the booth.

        OLMSTEAD had said that there had to be a trespass, KATZ overturned that

        HOLDING:  in katz's favor bc the gov's warrantless search violated his privacy

        "the 4th amendment protects people, not places"

        outcome:  evidence suppressed

        REOP = Reasonable Expectation of Privacy

        TEST: Harlan's concurrence

            -subjective (actual) expectation of privacy
            -reasonable/legitimate expectation of privacy

    HESTER

        p370

        bootlegger caught selling whiskey, cops had trespassed onto his property and observed from 100 yards

        rule: the 4th amendment rights do not apply to open fields

        the curtilage is the area surrounding the house

    OLIVER

        guy growing pot, cops walk a mile onto his property, passing no trespassing signs

        HOLDING:  not a search, never REOP in "open fields"

        fields aren't sacred private spaces

        OPEN FIELDS: area outside curtilage

            "An open field need be neither 'open' nor a 'field'"

    DUNN

        CURTILAGE:

            -distance from house
            -presence of enclosure
            -nature of use of area
            -steps taken to protect the area form observation

        cops walk onto a property and peek into a barn

    CIRAOLO/RILEY

        p372

        cops flying over and observing from above

        C: 1000 ft in a plane
        R: 400 ft in a helicopter

        both observed pot plants

        Was this a search?

            3 approaches:

                -commercial flight traffic is common today, no REOP
                -cops didn't violate FAA regs therefore public coulda been there, no REOP
                -who has the burden of proving amount of air traffic?

    BOND

        p376

        border patrol feels up a bag while checking on immigration status, he finds a brick

        squeezing the bag goes beyond what you expect to happen to your bag on a bus

        [sometimes consent is enough, but here he got consent based on an initial search]

        the touch/squeeze difference is hard to determine, and easily manipulated by cops

    HOFFA

        4th does not protect your trust interest in a colleague who is actually a narc

        if you tell somebody something, you have no privacy interest in it

        this case relies on the recollection of the guy who was there

    WHITE

        whether the 4th bars testimony betwen white and an informant where the conversation was heard via electronic bug

        the informant was not available to testify, so this case relies on a wire recording

        he had an actual but not a reasonable expectation of privacy

        R: you lose control of the info you share with another person

        POLICY: this rule suppresses authentic natural daily interactions

            but there are some crimes you couldn't police without these tools

    MILLER/SMITH

        3rd party doctrine cases

        IF YOU GIVE YOUR INFO TO A 3RD PARTY, YOU HAVE NO REOP

    GREENWOOD

        do you have a REOP in your trash?

            NO REOP IN TRASH

        if you do, then it's a search for them to root through it

        the court says no, you have no REOP

            bc "we can't expect the police to avert their eyes" from that which is in public

                but it's in an opaque bag

                    c/a but any kid, snoop, or animal could have strewn it about

                but there's a reg that requires residents to place the trash on the curb weekly

                    c/a you're handing it to a 3rd party

                        c/c/a but it gets intermingled with other trash

    DOW CHEMICAL

        aerial snooping over a chemical plant is ok bc it's a regulated commercial facility

        they used enhanced photography

    KYLLO

        the court finds a search where the cops had used a thermal camera to detect the thermal signature of a pot growing operation

        TEST:  how prevalent and available is the technology used?

        it's a search because of the uncommon method used and it's not limited to observing things outside the home.

        HOME HAS SPECIAL PROTECTION UNDER THE 4TH AMENDMENT

    KNOTTS

        ether beeper case 1

        no 4th violation bc no REOP in your movements

        the tech is the issue here, and they lose on that

    KARO

        ether beeper case 2

        key difference:  this beeper goes inside several different homes

        the wholesale acceptance of a bugged barrel is the hangup here

        part of your property rights include a right to not have a bug in your drum

        so maybe this is a seizure

    JONES

        "this upends 4th amendment jurisprudence"

        GPS bug placed on D's car

        Scalia sees the trespass as enought to qualify the bug as a 4th amendment event

            revives the Olmstead view

        two technical problems complicate things

            day 11 on a ten day warrant
            in wrong jdx

        HOLDING: GPS bug is a search bc it's a trespass and they have intent to gather info

            this test is added to KATZ now

            KNOW THE HOLDING, KNOW THE CONCURRENCES

        ALITO:  the tech is cheap, so no kyllo issue. 4 weeks of snooping is too much

            Time and Cost of tech play here

Day 4
1/25/16

    Search Analysis:

        1- was there a search?
            -katz REOP test
            -jones/jardines trespassory interest
        2- if yes, did the search comply with the requirements of the fourth amendment?
        3- if no, what is the remedy?

        big secondary questions:

            -is it a HOME being searched?
            -what is the intent of the cop?

    JONES CONTINUED

        SCALIA'S Elements of Trespass Test

            -a trespass occurs
            -the trespass is onto an enumerated 4thA item
            -it occurs with the purpose/intent to find something or obtain info

        ALITO'S CONCURRENCE

            maj overemphasizes trespass
            issue is actually duration
            3rd Party Doctrine
            he likes the REOP test from KATZ
            property considerations

            no GPS bugs.  follow the old fashioned way only.

                a process hurdle in the way causes police to make better decisions.
                more resources req'd means cops only pursue the bad bad guys

    KNOTTS/KARO/JONES RECAP

        -trespass is a problem with beepers (jones)
        -[tech+duration] is a problem

        these cases can be harmonized RE trespass
        knotts: no REOP in your movements on public thoroughfares
        karo: beeper drum moves into several different homes, special protection

    CABALLES

        gloss on PLACE (H: drug sniffing dog in airport is not a search bc they only disclose the presence of narcotics/contraband)

        drug sniffing dog rule extended to traffic stops

        not a search unless it unreaosnably extends the length of the seizure

    JARDINES

        F: drug sniffing dog detects pot smell.  they go and get a warrant, and find pot.

        ISSUE: was the dog sniff a search that invalidates the later warrant?

        police used device not in public use (analogy to thermal camera in kyllo)
        this is in the porch of a HOME (this makes it less like place and caballes)

        GOV would argue:  dog sniff is not a search

            C/A, this is after jones

                there's a physical trespass on the curtilage of the home

                    gov: though, there's an implied license to approach a porch

                but not to snoop aggressively or "look into" the house

                    gov: "knock and talk" is ok under the 4th

                    and place and caballes say dog sniff is not search bc narrow

                this is different bc they brought superdog

                    gov: dogs are an ancient and common tool in copland

                    and a normal human could have smelled it w/o dog

        HOLDING:
            the gov's use of trained police dogs
            to investigate the home and its immediate surroundings
            is a search within the meaning of the 4thA

    DRAYTON

        F:  cops get on bus, one posts up at front, one posts up at rear, one moves through cabin hassling passengers

            they consent to some searches, and get into some trouble

        I: did the police seize the passengers by taking control of the bus?

            if yes, everything afterwards is tainted

        how do we know when someone is seized?

            whether they are free to leave/terminate the enounter

            RULE: a person is not seized when he has freedom to leave (mendenhall) or free to terminate the encounter (this adapts the rule to the bus context)

            factors:

                -number of cops
                -threatening presence
                -weapon display or presence
                -physical touching
                -language and tone (asking or directing)

            It's not enough that the D did not feel free.  A reasonable person std instead.
            We consider reasonable, innocent, [white?] cilvilians.

            Cop's subjective experience not determinative either.

        HOLDING:  because they did not ask to leave the encounter, they consented to the seizure and in turn their consent to the search was effective

            11th C: the cop should have to inform the subject of his right to terminate

            SCOTUS:  no obligation to inform the subject of his freedom to leave

    4THA SEIZURE ANALYSIS:

        -was there a 4thA seizure?
        -if yes, did the seizure comply with the reqs of the 4thA
        -if no, what is the remedy?

            this does not turn on the officer's intent

        an arrest is the classic seizure

            cops needs probable cause to arrest
            but not always a warrant

        a Terry Stop is another type

            cop needs reasonable suspicion
            and can frisk you for safety

        a DWI checkpoint is a seizure

            but its reasonable under certain guidelines, even without suspicion

        a MENA style "search warrant seizure" does not require reasonable suspicion or PC

        [ostensibly, a cop cannot use a refusal to stay and talk as grounds for R/S]

    HODARI

        police pursuit case

        physical force seizure: when cop touches suspect
        show of authority seizure: when suspect submits to cop's authority

        here, a guy tossed crack while chased by cop

        he was not seized bc he had not yet SUBMITTED to the cop's authority

Day 5
1/27/16

    EXAM:  is access of cell site metadata a search?

        Know these cold: Jones, Katz, Kyllo

    Was there a seizure?  Draw on the four seizure rules:

    FOUR SEIZURE RULES

        -MENDENHALL/DRAYTON:

            not a seizure if a normal person would feel free to leave/end
            no requirement for cops to advise freedom to terminate

            factors:

                number of officers
                threatening presence
                weapon display
                physical touching
                language/tone

        -BROWER:

            purely accidental stop does not trigger 4thA
            but driver who collided with roadblock was seized

        -BRENDLIN: when you've stopped the driver, you've stopped everyone in the car

        -HODARI: fleeing suspect is not seized by pursuing gov agents.

            only force by cop or submission by suspect counts as a seizure

    EXAM PREP:

        know what questions to ask, know what cases require them

    Practice Problem Review:

        -duration
        -pretense
        -technology v manpower
        -threat as seizure
        -search of info trusted to a 3rd party
        -home, car, person get special analysis

        From the start of a search analysis, decide whether it's a REOP analysis or a TRESPASS analysis

        Be prepared to analyze a new technology (super cocaine sniffer)

            is it more like PLACE/JARDINES or KYLLO?

        Seizure:

            Conditional language by cops about freedom to leave cuts in favor of a seizure
            Blocked exits
            Number of officers

        Third Party Doctrine

    ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK:

        1- was there a search or seizure?
            if no search or seizure, no 4thA application
        2- if yes, did the cops comply with the 4thA requirements?
            traditional model
                warrant and PC required
                exceptions to warrant reqs
            reasonableness model
        3- if no, what is the remedy?

    ABOVE IS ALL ABOUT DEFINING 4thA SEARCHES AND SEIZURES

    NOW, WE'RE TALKING COMPLIANCE

    Is there even a warrant requirement?

        some interpret the 4th to mean: no warrant requirement
        the 4th is about requirements for when you do get a warrant
        not a req that you always get one

        these people advance the "reasonable" part more than the "warrant" part

    Adequacy of a Warrant:

        -Neutral decisionmaker
            no bias COOLIDGE
            no dough CONNALLY
            no req of legal training SHADWICK
            no in-person req McNEELY/RILEY

        -Probable cause

        -Particularity

        -Oath/Affirmation

            Affidavit must be comprehensive, no sandbagging WHITELY
            Affidavit must be true, no twisting or omitting FRANKS

        -Time, Place, Manner

Day 6
2/1/2016

    Warmup:

        [The 4thA] protection consists in requiring that
        those inferences be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate,
        instead of being judged by the officer
        engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.

        An evaluation before the search is better because it mitigates the effect of hindsight bias

        When police have to seek a warrant before hand, two ex ante judgments have been made.

    ["reasonable suspicion" is a term saved for terry stops]

    WILSON:  you have to knock and announce unless there's a reason not to

        exceptions: officer safety, preservation of evidence

            exception from BANKS: reasonable suspicion of an exigency

                the rule after wilson and banks:

                no blanket exception to knock and announce for felony drug cases, but if no one's at the door within 15-20 seconds, kick it in

    "Search Warrant Seizures"

        SUMMERS: you can detain occupants of the target without suspicion during a search

        MENA: you can handcuff occupants for 2-3 hours during a search

        BAILEY: no detention of a guy who left when he's a mile away

            they had RS to stop him, but probably not PC to arrest him and movie him

            BAILEY imposes a geographical limitation on SUMMERS

    "Sneak and Peak Warrants" 429

        cops can allow a search without giving notice to the occupants (before or after) if court believes notice of the execution of the warrant will screw things up

            30 day limit or longer if justifiable

        this comes up mostly in the national security context (PATRIOT ACT)

    PROBABLE CAUSE BEGINS HERE

    BRINEGAR 432

        PC exists when

            the facts and circumstances
            within the cops' knowledge
            and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information
            are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution
            in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed

    YOU NEED PC TO ARREST OR TO SEARCH OR TO SEIZE

    NATHANSON: mere affirmance of belief or suspicion is not enough

        not even from an old pro

    DRAPER: cop corroboration of info in informants' tip validates

        specificity counts
        accuracy of prediction counts
        innocence of corroborated conduct matters
        track record of the informant matters
        anonymity matters

        Still good law under totality of the circumstances test

    SPINELLI: two prong test introduced (abandoned in GATES)

        -Veracity/Reliability
            established by corroboration (Draper factors)
        -Basis of Knowledge
            established by corroboration
            specific to future events
            intimacy between suspect and rat

        some states still use this
        states can have a higher standard
        fed con crim law sets the floor

    GATES: IL-FL drug run case

        abandons SPINELLI std and adopts "totality of the circumstances"
        anonymous tip affords little basis of knowledge
            but it did predict a lot of future behavior that was later corroborated
            this is different from DRAPER because we don't know the informant

        no more technical standard

    ORNELAS: PROBABLE CAUSE is review DE NOVO on appeal in warrantless searches

        this is not true de novo review though

            they review facts only for clear error
            and they give "due weight" to officers and district court
            which locks in the crap and leaves no room for meaningful review

        more deferential is employed in review of warrant searches

        F: CA plates on a "drug dealer" car with a loose panel

    HARRIS: a certified dog has a presumption that its alerts provide PC

        D can still argue on the dog's shitty record
            but you're gonna cary the burden, and where do you get the info
            plus hindsight bias

Day 7
2/3/2016

    RULE:  What the officer knows has to be written out in the warrant

    PC factors for tips:  innocence of conduct, corroboration by cops, accurate prediction

    HERE STARTS THE WARRANT EXCEPTIONS SECTION

    The EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES exception to the warrant "requirement"

        four key questions:

            -when does the exigency expire? (MINCEY)
            -are the suspects fleeing? (WARDEN)
            -is destruction of evidence possible?
                THREE ABOVE REQUIRE PC, THE ONE BELOW DOES NOT
            [-are the cops engaging in community caretaking?]

            RULE: cops must have probable cause to search, and the exigency prevents the option of seeking a warrant

    MINCEY

        RULE: a limited amount of unwarranted searching is permissible at a homicide scene in order to secure the safety of possible victims and officers.  you can detain and grab weapons

            the push in the first ten minutes and then poking around that follows is where we draw the line

            four days of searching cannot be justified by the exigency

        RULE: a warrantless search must be strictly circumscribed by the exigencies which justify its initiation

        cite this case to support a warrant preference model

    WARDEN

        BUIE:  you're allowed to do a sweep of the house

        RULE:  cops in hot pursuit can follow a fleeing felony suspect into a house and conduct a limited search there

        speed is essential, and safety plus evidence are key

    WELSH

        WARDEN does not control here because welsh was not a felon, and the pursuit was not hot.  The gov's best argument would be destruction fo evidence through metabolism

        RULE: the hot pursuit exception to the warrant requirement does not extend to cool pursuit

        RULE: the severity of the offense helps to determine whether there's an exigency

    ELKINS

        cops see a pot plant through a hole in a wall, then detain a person outside the building, and then saw a guy aware of the cops go into the building

        this gives them reason to believe that evidence would be destroyed

        they had PC to believe he had pot in the building

        RULE:  cops can enter to search even if they were partly responsible for creating the exignecy

    JOHNSON

        cops hang outside a door and listen, the door opens

        the cops lies about what he had seen inside the apartment

        therefore the court recognized no PC

    KY v KING

        undercover cop making a drug buy.  they follow him to a two-apartment fork.  they smell pot under one door.  they choose that door, but they're wrong

        they knock and yell police (think JARDINES), they enter when they hear shuffling

            [knock and announce is a warrant procedure, knock and talk is a warrantless PC procedure]

        I: whether they created the exigency that allowed them to go into the apartment and in turn, whether that is a legit exigent circumstances exception candidate

        RULE:  where the police did not create the exigency by engaging or threatening to engage in conduct that violates the 4thA, warrantless entry to prevent the destruction of evidence is reasonable and thus allowed

        objective reasonability is the key

            the subjective intent of the cops does not matter

            bad faith by cops is no deal breaker because its so hard to prove the bad faith
