    Intro:

            Gouldin:  Don't transcribe the class

            This is the cops-and-robbers course
            Con Crim Adj is the bail-to-jail

            No statutory law in this course, lots and lots of cases

        System Actors:

            Prosecutors- bring charges and decide which to bring, plea deals (+95%)

            Defense- 5th and 6th amendment rights to counsel

            Police/Investigator- make arrests, gather info/conduct searches, interrogation, decide which crimes to investigate, preventative/regulatory harrassment

            Legislators- define crimes and define sentence ranges, lots of things are criminal

            Judges- issue warrants, admit evidence, drive sentencing

            Grand Jury- formal charging

            Informants!

        Themes:

            Gap between ideal and actual system

                assmebly line/crime control v. obstacle course/due process

            Relationship between procedural requirements and underlying offense

            Practical/Strategic application of procedural requirements

            Impacts of technology

            The difficulty of reconciling system goals

                accuracy (truth-seeking function)
                privacy
                liberty (limited gov)
                security (impact of 9/11 realigned priorities)
                efficiency (resource constraints)
                fairness (discretion, racial disparities)

        The FOURTH AMENDMENT

            4thA is divided into reasonableness clause and warrant clause

                a warrant means the search or seizure is reasonable

            it protects the right of "the people"

                that is, US people.  not US citizens overseas, not foreigners, maybe illegals

            it "protects" against the government

            what counts as unreasonable is the inquiry of this course

            "seizures" include people and stuff

            "shall not be violated" is silent on remedies
