CON LAW DAY 2

Equal Protection

Constitutional affirmations of slavery:

3/5s clause 
ban on banning the slave trade
fugitive slave laws

BUT,

the constitution never uses the word SLAVE
and theres no explicit protection for slavery


The politics of slavery were structured by the constitution
representation in the senate is equal

protection of slavery was piped through the senate

missouri compromise repealed by kansas-nebraska act


the institutions that protected slavery were baked into constitutionalism

no abolition without consent of the slave owning states

DRED SCOTT v SANDFORD


“Dred Scott” gets full name billing in the case name because he’s property

Dred claimed to be free by virtue of being in Illinois and other non-slavery territories (louisiana territory)

left slave state into free land (free state, free territory)

claims this makes him free

he’s bringing the claim in federal court based on diversity jdx

diversity jdx exists where there’s citizens from two different states involved in one controversy

the court looks to the const to determine who is a citizen of Missouri and whether Dred is or not

connect to Mccullough v maryland:
states are really just factions.  they don’t get to tax the bank and they don’t get to decide who counts as a citizen

the justifications for this case aren’t just racist, they’re also backed by other grounds.

slavery was interwoven into the society

citizens means people of the united states

what does “people of the united states mean?”

it means citizens, it means people who were free at the time of the constitution

the court finds that no slave or slave descendant is a member of the people of the US

citizenry means in the const sense sovereign people who hold power and conduct gov’t through their representatives

congress can create citizens through the power of naturalization

“aliens being free white…” could be made citizens

declaration of independence claims all men are created equal

it’s prior authority to the constitution

Taney’s definition of citizenship excludes a bunch of people like white women who thought they were citizens

but he doesn’t care about them, he only cares about crafting a definition that excludes Dred Scott


Taney claims that the public opinion about slavery and subjugation of blacks was fixed and solid

he says you can’t take general language and flex it to allow for citizenship of slaves because it’s totally contrary to public opinion

diversity jdx not available bc DS not a citizen

anyway, the forum state’s laws apply

even still, the property can’t just be taken away (takings clause)

const and public opinion don’t allow for different treatment of slavery compared to other forms of property


if you want to change the meaning of state citizenship, don’t lobby the state, you gotta amend the const


the civil war resulted in three amendments (13, 14, 15)

13th prohibits slavery
14th overturns Dred Scott (birthright citizenship)
15th guarantees the right to vote

14th is of central importance
especially equal protection clause

what kind of equality is guaranteed by the 14th?

plessy v ferguson answers this question

LA statute required equal and separate rail cars for blacks and whites

plessy was 7/8ths white but wouldn’t sit in the black section

this is a test case set up to test the constitutionality of separate public accommodations

the “property in racial reputation” argument was critical in the original case

the lawyer thought the property argument would hold up because ethyl like the protect property

turns out not

what kind of equality does the 14th guarantee?

equality between the races before the law.  

the court separates political equality from social equality

political: buy and sell property, vote, etc

14th guarantees political equality, not social equality

social equality is outside the social sphere, no government can make the races like each other

if you can accept the separation of political and social equality, should the gov’t enforce the social inequities?

the maj says the gov should be allowed to enforce the social reality of inequality

two step dance:  separate political and social inequality, then permit gov to enforce the social inequalities

maj makes a step three: gov can do any enforcement of inequality as long as it’s reasonable

TEST OF REASONABLENESS:

reasonable means that which (1) in good faith promotes public order, (2) consistent with traditional usages and customs, and (3) is not enacted merely to annoy or punish a particular group

STEP ONE: two equalities, political and social
STEP TWO: state can enforce social inequality through law
STEP THREE: can enforce social inequality only if reasonable
STEP FOUR: test for reasonableness with three elements

Plessy says that this separation of rail cars is designed to annoy him and his people

the court says that blacks don’t understand their rights, and that white people wouldn’t feel inferior if blacks passed a separation rule

the court says that plessy is just oversensitive

harlan is known as the great dissenter because of this and the civil rights case dissent

he’s straight up racist, but he thinks that the court’s opinion fails on a variety of terms:

1: political equality is at stake here, its not just social equality
2: this is clearly designed to oppress black people, violates reasonableness def of maj
3: this is not a good faith effort to promote public good, it produces racial tension, it fails reasonableness

harlan says that the court fails to apply its own doctrine correctly

he also claims the court should not be judging reasonableness or the expediency of regulation

though, they do of course.  he thinks the real rule of reasonableness is colorblindness

the law must be colorblind

1: they get the application wrong, not reasonable
2: they get the test wrong, should be colorblindness


both colorblindness and reasonableness stay with us

brown v board: political and social equality distinction exploded
