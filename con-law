CON LAW DAY 2

Equal Protection

Constitutional affirmations of slavery:

3/5s clause
ban on banning the slave trade
fugitive slave laws

BUT,

the constitution never uses the word SLAVE
and theres no explicit protection for slavery


The politics of slavery were structured by the constitution
representation in the senate is equal

protection of slavery was piped through the senate

missouri compromise repealed by kansas-nebraska act


the institutions that protected slavery were baked into constitutionalism

no abolition without consent of the slave owning states

DRED SCOTT v SANDFORD


“Dred Scott” gets full name billing in the case name because he’s property

Dred claimed to be free by virtue of being in Illinois and other non-slavery territories (louisiana territory)

left slave state into free land (free state, free territory)

claims this makes him free

he’s bringing the claim in federal court based on diversity jdx

diversity jdx exists where there’s citizens from two different states involved in one controversy

the court looks to the const to determine who is a citizen of Missouri and whether Dred is or not

connect to Mccullough v maryland:
states are really just factions.  they don’t get to tax the bank and they don’t get to decide who counts as a citizen

the justifications for this case aren’t just racist, they’re also backed by other grounds.

slavery was interwoven into the society

citizens means people of the united states

what does “people of the united states mean?”

it means citizens, it means people who were free at the time of the constitution

the court finds that no slave or slave descendant is a member of the people of the US

citizenry means in the const sense sovereign people who hold power and conduct gov’t through their representatives

congress can create citizens through the power of naturalization

“aliens being free white…” could be made citizens

declaration of independence claims all men are created equal

it’s prior authority to the constitution

Taney’s definition of citizenship excludes a bunch of people like white women who thought they were citizens

but he doesn’t care about them, he only cares about crafting a definition that excludes Dred Scott


Taney claims that the public opinion about slavery and subjugation of blacks was fixed and solid

he says you can’t take general language and flex it to allow for citizenship of slaves because it’s totally contrary to public opinion

diversity jdx not available bc DS not a citizen

anyway, the forum state’s laws apply

even still, the property can’t just be taken away (takings clause)

const and public opinion don’t allow for different treatment of slavery compared to other forms of property


if you want to change the meaning of state citizenship, don’t lobby the state, you gotta amend the const


the civil war resulted in three amendments (13, 14, 15)

13th prohibits slavery
14th overturns Dred Scott (birthright citizenship)
15th guarantees the right to vote

14th is of central importance
especially equal protection clause

what kind of equality is guaranteed by the 14th?

plessy v ferguson answers this question

LA statute required equal and separate rail cars for blacks and whites

plessy was 7/8ths white but wouldn’t sit in the black section

this is a test case set up to test the constitutionality of separate public accommodations

the “property in racial reputation” argument was critical in the original case

the lawyer thought the property argument would hold up because ethyl like the protect property

turns out not

what kind of equality does the 14th guarantee?

equality between the races before the law.

the court separates political equality from social equality

political: buy and sell property, vote, etc

14th guarantees political equality, not social equality

social equality is outside the social sphere, no government can make the races like each other

if you can accept the separation of political and social equality, should the gov’t enforce the social inequities?

the maj says the gov should be allowed to enforce the social reality of inequality

two step dance:  separate political and social inequality, then permit gov to enforce the social inequalities

maj makes a step three: gov can do any enforcement of inequality as long as it’s reasonable

TEST OF REASONABLENESS:

reasonable means that which (1) in good faith promotes public order, (2) consistent with traditional usages and customs, and (3) is not enacted merely to annoy or punish a particular group

STEP ONE: two equalities, political and social
STEP TWO: state can enforce social inequality through law
STEP THREE: can enforce social inequality only if reasonable
STEP FOUR: test for reasonableness with three elements

Plessy says that this separation of rail cars is designed to annoy him and his people

the court says that blacks don’t understand their rights, and that white people wouldn’t feel inferior if blacks passed a separation rule

the court says that plessy is just oversensitive

harlan is known as the great dissenter because of this and the civil rights case dissent

he’s straight up racist, but he thinks that the court’s opinion fails on a variety of terms:

1: political equality is at stake here, its not just social equality
2: this is clearly designed to oppress black people, violates reasonableness def of maj
3: this is not a good faith effort to promote public good, it produces racial tension, it fails reasonableness

harlan says that the court fails to apply its own doctrine correctly

he also claims the court should not be judging reasonableness or the expediency of regulation

though, they do of course.  he thinks the real rule of reasonableness is colorblindness

the law must be colorblind

1: they get the application wrong, not reasonable
2: they get the test wrong, should be colorblindness


both colorblindness and reasonableness stay with us

brown v board: political and social equality distinction exploded


CON LAW DAY 3

Last time:

Dred Scott.  The constitution and representational politics all protected slavery.  Slavery was not to be changed without the consent of the slave owning states.

Dred Scott was about protecting the status quo.

Dred Scott Majority federalized the meaning of citizenship

1- when it comes to dealing with a moral issue like slavery, we don’t decide on morality.  we decide on constitutionality.  we apply the law as written

2- we look to see what the intentions were at the time the law was written.  Dred Scott is an Originalist decision.

they say the intentions (to protect slavery) were universal and part of the fabric of society

any general language about “blessings of liberty” or “all men are created equal” must be understood through the lens of intention

they also determined that the law of the forum state (missouri) held.  his status is decided by missouri law.

they say the court had no power to prevent slavery in federal territories.

they say congress doesn’t have the power because public opinion is all for slavery.

since slaves were property and property was protected, congress lacks the power to prevent slavery in fed territories and the missouri compromise is unconstitutional

CITIZENSHIP is still federalized, but now its about birth

14th amendment overturns Dred Scott, but it does not address racial hierarchy

13th abolished slavery, 14th requires equal protection

what does equal protection mean?

plessy v ferguson answers this

it tells us 14th guarantees political equality not social equality

social beliefs can’t be changed by law says the court

1- law cannot change social standing
2- law CAN reinforce social inequality and hierarchies and social distinctions

reinforcement of these social distinctions must be reasonable

plessy three elements:

1. reaonsably enforce social inequality to enforce social order
2. jives with traditional values (established culture)
3. not designed for the annoyance of a race

it’s reasonable to separate rail cars because it’s within the police power of the state to keep people from fist fighting (social order)

it’s traditional just like separate schools

plessy is annoyed, but that’s because he doesn’t understand his rights

Harlan dissents and says its plainly to oppress
it won’t create order because it builds tension
it’s not reasonable, even under the court’s doctrine

more radically, he says the rule of the constitution is colorblindness

if the law uses race, the gov’t can’t do it

it shouldn’t contemplate the reasonableness of any law that uses race

this is Harlan’s reading of what equal protection means, it’s not anywhere in the constitution explicitly

Harlan is still a total racist despite the relative enlightenment of his positions



BROWN v BOARD OF EDUCATION OF TOPEKA

the most celebrated decision in the modern canon

schools were segregating racially across the country

why don’t they use original intentions?

they say the history of the amendment is inconclusive

	HISTORY

			public education didn’t exist in its current form.

			also now, education is compulsory

			it’s an apples to oranges comparison


			there’s an imperfect documentary record

			but more importantly, the original intentions didn’t jive with the outcome they wanted

			they claim the history they see is too mixed to be useful

			but really, they’re just getting past the hangup on original intentions

			they’re also calling the “traditional values” part of the Plessy test of reasonableness

ORIGINAL INTENTIONS ARE USELESS


education is public by ’54

public education is required for good citizenship (very foundation of good citizenship)

education is in the social sphere of plessy’s political/social distinction

citizenship in brown is political

therefore, education is really at least partly political

Warren is collapsing the distinction between political and social equality

“where a state undertakes to provide education, it must do so on an equal basis”



third leg: STIGMA

plessy never says separate but equal.

but, the court operationalizes separate but equal as satisfactory to the “reasonableness” test

materially equal is the de facto test

	NAACP litigation pushes the court to recognize the intangible factors

	the grad school advances later help to set up the push into k-12 education

the colorblindness approach gets us out of the reasonableness analysis

but the Brown court doesn’t do that

they do a stigma analysis instead

they say instead that the official separation by race imposes a stigma and feelings of inferiority

the schools could be equal in every tangible and intangible way, but there’d still be stigma

separate is inherently unequal

the stigmatic argument is narrower than the colorblindness approach


Brown cites some social science studies that show that feelings of inferiority exist in students in segregated schools

the stigmatic argument uses social science

Brandeis had been using social science as legal argument since 1908



So what do we do now?

at least, you can’t assign pupils on the basis of race.

you can still have 100% white schools, you can still have anti-miscegenation laws



BROWN II

enforcement mechanism of Brown I

make a start toward desegregation with all deliberate speed

they delegate the job to the district courts

this started an era where the courts were actively involved in the supervision of schools

	(hospitals and prisons were too)

they say you can’t just disagree with Brown and do nothing

but everything else is pretty much in the open

they leave it all to be worked out in litigation at the lower court levels

they prohibit de jure segregation, but leave plenty of wiggle room for de facto segregation

facial de jure segregation: white kids go here, black kids go there

de jure is official

de facto is in fact

unofficial, but it’s the way things are in fact

the policy is: go to school where you want, but everyone ends up segregated

this is de facto segregation


BROWN doesn’t use de jure and de facto

but it tells us that de jure segregation in public schools is prohibited

BUT brown leaves a lot of wiggle room for de facto segregation



Is sexual orientation something that can be analogized to race?

different treatment (disability imposed) based on non-choice

the court is going to be skeptical about race in the post-brown era

the closer a trait is to race, the more skeptical we should be about the gov’t using that characteristic as a basis for different treatment

wealth is not like race and sexual orientation.
