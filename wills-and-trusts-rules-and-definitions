WILLS & TRUSTS RULES and DEFINITIONS

WILLS

    Forced share: certain amount goes to [each kid]

    community property state: earnings in a marriage are split 50/50

    elective share: allows a spouse to claim a portion of the decedent’s estate despite a will to the contrary

    ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE: donor’s intent, to be read from the document

    testate: died with a will

	intestate: died without a will

	specific devises: give a particular thing to a particular group

	general devise: cash gift

	residuary clause: sweeps up the rest

	gift over clause: to A but if A is not alive, to B

    personal representative: person who will handle the estate

    if its a partial restriction, it’s generally valid

    “no remarriage” would be struck

    you do not have a right to inherit

    you do not have a constitutional right to devise

    you have a constitutional right to devise to your children

    There can be partial intestacy if there’s no residuary clause.

    Courts normally appoint the competent person who’s getting the most stuff

    one theory: you can only pass by will what you own at your death

    real property is governed by its situs

    domicile at death governs for everything else

    residency is defined by IRS and governs for income tax purposes

    domicile is different

    ancillary probate is for the out of state stuff.  its hellish

    heir is someone who would take under intestacy

    devisees, beneficiaries, and legatees take under a will

    Braman rule sends posthumously acquired property to the heir

    UPC uniform probate code sends it to the residuary devisee

    probate includes anything under a will, testamentary trust, anything in your sole name like a checking account, real estate

    non probate includes life insurance policies, inter vivos trust, joint tenancies, retirement (401k account), transfer on death/payable on death accounts, TOD real estate

    THIS ALL GETS TAXED, whether probate or not.  it’s all in the gross estate on death.

    a will cannot overcome a joint tenancy, or the 401k designated beneficiary

    CREDITORS get paid before beneficiaries

    Probate Types

		1) formal probate - big, expensive, lots of people involved

		2) informal probate - has grown up in the last 20 years.  if no interested party objects after getting notice of the will, then it doesn’t need court supervision.  the PR gets appointed, and the court signs off at the end, not other involvement.  notice goes to last known address.

		3) small - anything under 40-50 grand.  no court needed.  just go to clerk or registrar and you can get title.

    interested party- heirs, beneficiaries under the will, and the known creditors

    professionals like doctors should go through probate because it bars creditors under non claim statutes

    posting notice in the newspaper limits the window for creditors to come forward

    a guardian at litem represents a minor

    the probate court’s only function is to interpret the will by the clear text of the will itself.
        no extrinsic evidence allowed.
        probate courts have a different function than other courts.

    if you die without a will, you die intestate

    THE ELECTIVE SHARE CAN OVERCOME THE INTESTACY SCHEME.

        the elective share can be higher than the intestate share

        the intestacy statutes often only apply to probate assets

        the elective share is often a lower percentage, but it applies to a bigger pile

    USDA says a survivor must outlive the decedent by five days

    Where to make the “first cut”:

		1) ENGLISH - first cut always at children’s level

		2) MODERN - first cut at the level where someone is alive

		3) UPC - same as modern

		modern method: first cut, disburse, pool funds, go to next level, disburse, pool funds, go to next level, etc

		under the UPC, everyone on the same level should get the same percentage

	TWO SOLID, UNIVERSAL RULES:

		1) when a line dies out, you ignore it completely
		2) ignore a descendant whose parent is alive

    UPC:

        anyone who is not a lineal descendant of a grandparent does not take

        they give half to maternal grandparent’s side and half to paternal grandparent’s side

        when you disinherit someone, you can’t block his line, but you can skip him so he’s treated like he’s dead

        you can explicitly disinherit B and his whole line, but if you only disinherit B, it only skips him

    the transplantation/rebirth theory says that if someone else adopts the children, then they are not the descendants of the genetic parents

    NY, et al disallow the adoption of a person you’re sleeping with
        the relationship often sours after the adoption.
        there’s no divorce for adoption.

    the old way is the “stranger to the adoption rule”

        if A adopts B, and A dies, B can take A’s stuff

    posthumous child: conceived while dad is alive, born while dad is dead

        these kids always take under intestacy statutes

    posthumously conceived child: conceived [by in vitro fertilization] after Dad is dead

        all bets are off.  most state laws don’t handle this at all

    two reasons to bank sperm:

        -to make a child with their own sperm while infertile but living
        -to make a child with their sperm while dead

    Sprinkle Trust: it’s discretionary.  lineal descendants get or don’t get assets from the trust based on a choice by the [surviving spouse].  No mandatory distributions.

    Special Power of Appointment:  Anything that’s not a general power of appointment

        -if you can appoint to only a limited group, its a SPoA

    General Power of Appointment:  A gives B a power of appointment over a certain amount of money.

        -you can appoint yourself, creditors, estate, and creditors of your estate

    IRS says:  general power of appointment is like ownership, and so you get taxed.

        BUT: if you are restricted (SPoA) then it’s not taxed

    An advancement is a lifetime gift to a child that will be counted against that child’s share of his parent’s estate

        the common law presumption was that a gift was an advancement

        but

        now we say that a inter vivos gift is evidence that the parent favored the child more

    the UPC flips the common law rule

        it’s not an advancement unless there’s a contemporaneous writing saying it’s an advancement

    HANDLING GIFTS TO MINORS

        GUARDIANSHIP AND CONSERVATORSHIP

    		someone leaves dough to a kid, both parents are dead.

    		G or C handles the money and the kid until the kid hits the age of majority

        COURT APPOINTED GUARDIAN

    		“it’s just fucking awful” - Terry Turnipseed

    		its like probate every day.  a judge has to sign off on c purchases of clothes etc

    		some dipshit lawyer gets the task of cutting checks etc

    	CONSERVATOR

    		its a little better

    		it’s more like a trustee

    		but

    		you send an accounting once a year and check in on big ticket items

        UTMA “Custodianship”

    		better, because it allows a court to appoint a “trustee”

    		person who handles the minor’s money has a bit more freedom, less accounting to do

    		is not a stranger to the kid

    		it’s often best to leave a small amount under the UTMA

    	BEST THING:
    	TRUST

    		the money dumps in

    		you specify a trustee

    		you get to declare terms

    			(in all above the money comes out at 18 or 21 at the latest, and then that kid gets it outright)

    		but you can hold the trust until they’re older

    		you can specify education first, etc

    		trust terms can even survive an adoption!

    SLAYER RULE

		you can’t just kill a person to claim their stuff

		court imposes a constructive trust

		constructive means it’s a legal fiction

		we’re pretending to give title to the slayer so he holds it in trust for someone else

    DISCLAIMER

		you can disclaim money

		why?

			creditors
			tax avoidance
			medicare

		but the IRS can always get to it

        you save a 40% cut at the feds and more at the state level

        feds require:

			-writing
			-9 month window after gift or death
			-take no benefit
			-passes without direction from disclaim ant
			-valid under state law

		the IRS has a form to fill out


    WILL FORMALITIES

		most states still require specific and technical ways of creating a will

			1- WRITING
			2- SIGNED
			3- ATTESTED

		Attestation is the most frequently problematic

		some states also require

			4- Subscription
			5- Publication

		subscription: you need to sign it at the end.  some states throw it out, some throw out all that which follows.

		publication is an approving statement of all the above.  should be part of the execution ceremony.


		Functions of Formalities:

			-Evidentiary
			-Ritual/Cautionary
			-Protective
			-Channeling

        the testator can sign in advance, as long as he acknowledges it in front of both witnesses

        ANYTHING you put down that you mean to be your signature is valid

			initials, so long as you mean it to be your signature
			an X, if that’s all you can compose
			a nickname, if that’s what you intend to be your signature (lucky)

			not fine:

				if you start writing your full name, but you don’t finish it

		OR

			someone can sign on your behalf

				if they’re in your presence
				and
				you wish for them to sign the document, and that you mean it to be your signature

			This is true for attestation as well.  the witness can tell someone to write their name as a witness.

			You can also get someone to help you make your signature.  it must be at T’s direction.

		NO HEIRS OR BENEFICIARIES should sign as witnesses

		some jdx throw out the whole thing, some purge the beneficiary, and some purge the difference between the will and the intestate amount

		the ATTY SHOULD NOT also be the witness or the notary

			it adds an ugly wrinkle that will pique a judge’s interest

		The notary is not required, but two witnesses and a notary should all play along

        usually attached to the will is a self-proving affidavit that the witnesses sign

			a notary notarizes it

			it says that we the witnesses are swearing before a notary that all the requirements have been met

		before the advent of the self proving affidavit, you’d have to go find the witnesses and have them testify

        UPC says you can have two witnesses OR a notary

			but that provision of the UPC has not been widely adopted

		Presence

			two tests for presence:

				-old school Line of sight test

					you have to be able to see the testator and the other witnesses

					everyone has to be able to see everyone

					they don’t actually have to have seen, but they have to have been able to see

				-UPC and other jdx have the Conscious Presence Test

					you probably have to be in the same room as the others

		SUBSCRIPTION

			jdx handle things differently (see chart)

			NY tosses out anything below the signature line, and the will above is probated

		ATTESTATION CLAUSE

			a clause that says who it is that’s witnessing the will and provides for witness lines

			in many states, T must sign before Witnesses

		Proper order:

			T signs
			Witnesses sign
			sign self-proving affidavit
			notary signs off

		MAKE SURE THE WILL IS EXTREMELY WELL JOINED TOGETHER

			as many staples as you can put up top

			have the T initial each page

				it makes it harder to slip in a page

		THE MODEL EXECUTION CEREMONY is overkill, but it makes the will hold up in all jdx

			publication:

				we are gathered here to execute the will of X

			3 big questions:

				-Is this you will?
				-Have you read it and understood it?
				-Does it dispose of your property in accordance with your wishes?

					T must answer YES


    Background interested witness rule:

        -interested witness means your whole will is tossed
        -then they moved to purging

        Now, they purge the difference between benefit that the interested witness would receive under intestacy and under he will

        -some purge the whole interest
            -some states only purge excess

                -some purge relative to intestacy
                -some purge relative to old will

    Imperfect wills:

        Substantial compliance uses a constructive trust

            common law, judge-made

            deems it in compliance even where its not

        more modern is dispensing power (as under UPC)

        also called harmless error rule

            needs a statute

            forgives failure of compliance

            modern trend, accepted in a growing minority of states

        curing defects in execution is governed by a specialized set of rules

        reformation of mistakes in a document has a different set of rules

        harmless error excuses more than substantial compliance

        UPC ALLOWS YOU TO SWAP IN A NOTARY FOR ATTESTATION

        pretty much anything you write will count if you intended it to be your signature

    		whether the person has used that signature before is meaningful

    	PA allows completely unattested wills

        conditional wills are a terrible idea

    		but generally, per eaton, courts allow them to be probated

    	A will must be written, but need not be written on paper

    		very rarely, a nuncupative will is probated in some jdx

    Evidence of "this is how i want my stuff disposed" != "i want this document to be my will"

    if you revoke the original will, all the codicils after it drop

    if you revoke a codicil, the base will stands

    ways to revoke a will:

        -formal will expressly revokes a prior will
        -holograph expressly revokes
        -new F/H will displaces will
        -by act

    IMPERFECT DESTRUCTION:

        most jdx require that a ‘null and void’ writing on the face must touch some words of the will

        back of back cover does not constitute part of the will.  written on some scrap paper does not count

        whether or not the cancellation touches any of the words matters

        imperfect revocation by physical act?  UPC harmless error rule does not apply

        UPC harmless error rule only applies to writing

    revocable trusts are a will substitute used these days to avoid probate

        -you set it up
        -put in the terms
        -title your assets in the name of the revocable trust

        but
        sometimes shit gets left behind
        so
        you execute a pour over will

            POW: appoints a personal representative, maybe a few gifts, pours your probate assets into trust

                    then the trust takes over

    someone else can destroy a will for you, but it has to be at your direction and in your presence

    the contents of a HW need not be made all on the same day.

    DRR: Dependent Relative Revocation

        revocation of all or part of a will is ineffective if revocation is based on MISTAKE

        mistake negates T’s revocatory intent

            1) will 1
            2) will 2

                if you kill will 2, but did so because of some mistaken belief, will 2 is resurrected

        DRR does not go back and grab will 1 and bring it back to life

        but DRR is based on the preference of testacy over intestacy, so it brings back will 2

    spouse of an interested party can’t witness

    NO RESIDUE OF THE RESIDUE RULE

        Deceased residuary beneficiary's portion of the estate passes by intestate succession, as though the testator had left no will.

        The portion of the residuary estate that did not itself pass under the will could not be considered part of the residuary estate

        Under UPC section 2-604(b), if there are two parties in the remainder and one has not survived, the entirety of the remainder goes to the surviving residuary devisee or devisees.

    PARTIAL REVOCATION BY PHYSICAL ACT:

        some states allow, some don’t

        if the state doesn’t allow it, then it’s as if the strike through isn’t there at all

        if the state allows it, then that portion of the will is struck

    Revival

        UPC

            if will 2 revokes will 1, and then will 2 is revoked by act, the previous will remains revoked.

            if will 2 partially revokes will 1, and will 2 is revoked, will 1 is revived

    Revocation by operation of law

        if you get divorced (and some states require a written settlement), it kills the spouse’s benefits under the will

        but

        how about the non-probate assets (insurance, 401k, etc…)

        UPC says divorce revokes all governing instruments

            Gov Inst: pretty much everything.  deed, will, trust, policy, pay-on-death designations, etc

    Pretermitted X

        pretermitted spouse statutes

            events of will, marriage, death

            will does not mention spouse

            what happens to the will?

                there’s always the elective share

                the PRETERMITTED SPOUSE DOCTRINE revokes a will that you wrote before you married

        pretermitted child statutes

            events of will, child, death

            will does not mention kids

            what happens?

                these statutes will revoke your will on your behalf because they assume you just forgot to update yr will

    Integration doctrine

        this seeks to determine what documents count as part of the will

        all papers present and intended to be part are treated as part of the will

        incorporation by reference:

            the document must be in existence at the time of the will

    TPP memo: tangible personal property memorandum

    NY DOES NOT HAVE INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    republication by codicil

        execute a will 2000, execute a codicil 2010.  whole will is deemed executed 2010

        TPP memo, execute a will 2000 which incorporates by ref, change TPP memo.  memo zapped.

            TPP memo, execute a will 2000 which incorporates by ref, change TPP memo, execute a codicil. memo saved.

    UPC:  exists when will is executed, language of will manifests intent to incorporate and describes memo good

    UPC allows incorporation by reference, like most states

        -must predate will
        -must be described precisely by will
        -will must show intent to incorporate

    ACTS OF INDEPENDENT SIGNIFICANCE

        you cannot cite to a future act in your will

        baseline:  NOT VALID

            big exception: Acts of independent significance

            if the future act has meaning on its own outside of your testamentary intent, they let it in

                they’re trying to prevent will changes without formalities

                they don’t want you to say:

                    I keep a letter in my desk with names of people who get 500 bucks

                they will allow 500 to each employee

                    because it’s an act of independent sig, not just to decide who gets what

                    it’s in your control, but you decide on other reasons

                they will allow 500 to whatever charitable trust B sets up in his will

                    it’s out of your control, you can’t tweak your will without formalities

                There’s also a safe/safety deposit box exception

    a contract relating to a will must be in writing (to comply with the statute of frauds)

        because oral testimony is inevitably one-sided because death

    “We allow weird people to execute wills in this country.”  -Prof Turnipseed

    a crazy person can execute will as long as he was lucid at the time of creation of will

    proponent:  people trying to get the will probated
    contestants: people trying to show [lack of mental capacity / insane delusion]

        once the burden has shifted, it’s hard to overcome
        the person with whatever burden, loses

    INSANE DELUSIONS

		you can be perfectly competent in every way, but if you hold ONE REALLY WEIRD VIEW and it causes you to change your disposition, the will can be overturned

			1- T had insane delusion (this means NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE DELUSION)
			2- WILL was a product of the insane delusion (see note on 282)

	In almost all states that allow holographs, A DATE IS REQUIRED in addition to the signature requirement

    durable power of attorney:  good the moment its signed

    WHO BEARS THE BURDEN OF PROOF?

        1- the proponents of a will always have the initial burden of proving the will (that formalities were followed)

        2- contestant alleging UI must show:

        		-confidential relationship
        			-fiduciary
        			-reliant
        			-dominant/subservient
        		-suspicious circumstances (290-291)
        			-weakened
        			-wrongdoer participated
        			- independent advice
        			-secrecy or haste
        			-changes in donor’s attitudes or behaviors
        			-intuition

        3- burden flips back to proponents

        		-proponent must disprove his or her undue influence

        WHOEVER HAS THE ULTIMATE BURDEN OF PERSUASION ALMOST ALWAYS LOSES

    APPOINTING YOURSELF EXECUTOR

        it’s ok to appoint yourself as executor, but you have to suggest the list of people other than yourself first

    		they have to come up with the idea on their own

		you also need to make a letter afterwards indicating that you have written yourself in

			then the dude writes back saying he understood the other choices and chose you anyhow

    Warning signs for possible will challenges:

		-radical departure from prior longstanding Estate Planning
		-multiple/blended families
		-conditions on bequests
		-gift to mistresses or other people unpopular with family/heirs
		-unequal shares to kin of equal relation

    fraud

		causation is the tricky thing

		the fraud must be the cause of the change

		if the bastard was gonna do it anyhow, not fraud

	TORTIOUS INTEREFERENCE WITH AN EXPECTANCY

		elements:

			1) existence of an expectancy
			2) intentional interference with exp through tortious conduct
			3) causation
			4) damages

			an expectancy now includes probate and nonprobate assets

		this is tort, has nothing to do with the estate

			is not filed in probate court
			you can get into federal court if you meet the other qualifications
			and youve exhausted your administrative remedies

            THIS IS BADLY CRITICIZED AS BEING A "SECOND BITE FROM THE APPLE"

        		this allows punitive damages too

    CONSTRUCTION OF WILLS

		plain meaning given effect or let extrinsic evidence in?

		classic view: no reforming a will due to ambiguity or mistake

		update: patent and latent ambiguity distinction

			most states still recognize the difference

			patent is an inconsistency on the face of the doc (1/2 to A, 1/2 to B, 1/2 to C)

				no extrinsic evidence for patent ambiguity in most states

				(if you see a problem in the 4 corners of the will, no ext ev)

			latent ambiguity is an inconsistency not visible on the 4 corners

				extrinsic evidence is permitted here conventionally

				(1 million to Danny, 3 lovers named Danny)
				(my horse to my nephew joe, 2 horses and 3 joes)

		The restatement and others tries to do away with the distinction between patent and latent

    WILL REFORMATION

            NONREFORMATION guards against a false positive (fake-ass finding of mistake)

            REFORMATION prevents false negatives (preventing T's obvious intent b/c of formalism)

        SECRET REFORMATION:

            unambigous terms == no extrinsic evidence

            ambiguous terms on the face == ex ev allowed

            many jdx still have black letter law that prevent reformation for mistake

                some courts stick to it and really dont reform

                others will torque the hell out of law or facts to fix the error

        UPC:  allows reformation of a governing instrument where clear and convincing evidence

			GOVERNING INSTRUMENT: term of art.
                means pretty much everything.
                deed, will, trust, policy, pay-on-death designations, etc.

			UPC position is still minority

    	courts routinely allow for reformation in order to capture the tax benefits that the original instrument sought to capture


    STALE WILLS

        shit happens between execution and death

            beneficiaries might die
            classes can grow
            T's property changes

        FUNDAMENTAL RULE: lapsed or void devise:  no takey

            its a lapse if A dies before you

            its void if A was dead at the execution, or was a dog

                they have the SAME RULES, BUT DIFFERENT NAMES

        Specific bequests lapse into RRR

            if no RRR, then passes by intestacy

        General bequests lapse into RRR

            if no RRR, then passes by intestacy

        RRR lapses into intestacy (if RRR was only to one heir)

        RRR lapses partially into intestacy (if RRR was to more than one heir)

            if jdx uses no residuary of a residuary:

                RRR to A and B 50% each

                A dies
                B gets 50% of RRR
                A's share passes by intestacy

            if jdx has abandoned no R of R:

                RRR to A and B 50% each

                A dies
                B gets 100% of RRR

        Class Gifts

            A, B, C get a class gift

            A dies

            B and C split A's share

    ANTILAPSE

        make sure, before you do an antilapse analysis, that the testator did not make a statement that prevents operation of the antilapse statute

        antilapse statutes only apply to family, generally

        majority rule:  "If A survives me" blocks the operation of the antilapse statute

        minority and UPC:  "If A survives me" is boilerplate language, does not block ALS

            under the minority rule, you have to give a redirect (if A predeceases me, to B)

            under minority rule, boilerplate does not block antilapse

        ANTILAPSE ANALYSIS EXAM PROCEDURE:

            -scope: is predeceased beneficiary within the protected class? (is A family?)
            -lineage:  does beneficiry have surviving lineal descendants?
            -text:  is there expression of contrary intent in the will? ("if she survives me, else )

        minority no residue of residue:

            a lapsed [portion of a] gift falls into intestacy

        majority rule:

            a lapsed [portion of a] gift falls into RRR (if there's a second RRR beneficiary)

    CLASS GIFTS:

        a class gift is a gift to those who TAKE AS MEMBERS OF A GROUP and SHARES ARE DYNAMIC

        it's presumed to be a class gift if the benes are IDd by a term of relationship

        NOT A CLASS GIFT IF:

            benes are IDd by their names and the SHARES ARE FIXED

        MAJORITY:

			a class gift to a single generation: ALS applies
			a class gift across generations:  ALS does not apply

		MINORITY:

			ALS applies to both

    ADEMPTION

        what happens when your car predeceases you?

            -A gets nothing
            -A gets the value of the car
            -PR compelled to go buy a 2011 Honda Element, and give it to A
            -A gets whatever car T was driving at death

        IDENTITY THEORY: minority

            old shcool way:

            if you can identify it, then they get it
            if you cannot identify it in the estate, A gets nothing

            NY is an ID theory state

        INTENT THEORY: majority

            replacement property swaps in to fill the role of the devise
            if there's no replacement, A gets the value of the thing

    SATISFACTION

        operates like advancement in intestacy
        you give someone 10k in your will
        before you die but after execution, you give the guy 5k

        under common law, it was automatically subtracted out

            now, maj and UPC require a contemporaneous writing
            therefore the doctrine almost never applies

        This only applies to general gifts, not specific gifts

    EXONERATION OF LIENS

        if you leave someone a house with a lien on it
        does the estate have to pay off the lien
        or do you take subject to the lien?

        generally, it's answered by asking if the T was personally liable

            they almost always are

        if you are personally liable, then the UPC and MAJ say YOU TAKE SUBJECT TO THE LIEN

        old common law and minority: liens paid from residuary before the gift is made

    ABATEMENT

        operates like bankruptcy

        if you make lots of specific and general gifts, but you dont have that much property

        IT GOES LIKE THIS:

            RRR abates first
            GEN gifts abates next
            SPC gifts and demonstrative gifts abate next

        PRO RATA reduction reduces each share proportionately


TRUSTS

    Trustee holds the trust corpus in his own name.

    SD NV AK DE are major trust jdx

        they're in an arms race to see who can be the most trust-friendly

    FUNCTIONS OF A TRUSTEE

		1- custodial
		2- administrative
		3- investment
		4- distribution


		custodial:

			if you're the trustee and the building burns down, you're personally liabe if uninsured

		administrative:

			accounting for the transactions, sending annual reports and tax returns

		investment:

			beneficiaries care most about this
			trustees get better dough if they invest well too

		distribution:

			most are discretionary in this respect
			beneficiaries always want more distributions
			but trustee gets lower fees that way

				plus it puts him in a vulnerable place vis a vis the "remaindermen"
        Traditionally, these responsibilities went to one person
        The modern trend is to split these responsibilities up

    directed trust: trust company takes on custodial and admin functions, and sometimes investment

    NY is the worst jdx in the country to set up a trust

    Mutual funds are set up as business trusts

		that's not what we talk about
		they have a different body of law
		we're dealing with PERSONAL TRUSTS

    CREATION OF A TRUST

		1- intent to create a trust
		2- ascertainable beneficiaries
		3- specific property (res)
		4- [sometimes] writing [if land or will]

		ASCERTAINABLE BENES

			You can set up a valid trust for the benefit of unborn children
			they're not alive yet, but we know who they are
			the court can even appoint a guardian ad litem to protect the interest of the unborns

			ascertainable != born

			it can also be an incomplete class (to my children)

		SPECIFIC PROPERTY

			most jdx require it to be a non-nominal amount
			fund it with ten bucks, not one buck

			it doesn't have to be cash or tangible property

				it can be intellectual property
				it can be TPP
				it can be a future interest

            There must be a RES for the trust to be valid

		WRITING

			you CAN have an oral trust
				there's proof issues associated, but if you can prove it, its valid
			but they can't have land in them
			and they cant be testamanetary

    	INTENT to create a trust

    		you don't have to use the word trust to make one
    		just because you did use the word doesn't mean it is a trust

            INTENT for trusts is NOT intent for the benes to have the stuff

    			it's intent to create a trust

        LACK OF TRUSTEE

        	a trust will never fail for lack of a trustee

        		the court steps in to appoint one if needed
        		its the executor if testamentary trust

    ACCOUNTING: list of all the transactions and a statement as to how much dough

    ACCEPTING TRUSTEE ROLE

        you do not have to accept a trustee position if you don't want it

		it might not be a good place to dabble in
		if youre an attorney and you take on a fiduciary duty,

			YOUR NORMAL MALPRACTICE COVERAGE DOES NOT REACH

    			if you represent a fiduciary, youre covered
    			but if you get the fiduciary fee, you need to buy a rider to your policy

        Once you accept, you can't just resign

            unless there's a provision in the trust, you gotta get an OK from court

            most well drafted trust have a resignation feature

                but even then its a hassle

    RESULTING TRUST: it's a remedy.

        we take [a whole estate] and put it in trust.
        after the purpose is met, it results back to the settlor or the beneficiaries or the heirs.

    SELF SETTLED TRUST:

        A sets up a trust as settlor.
        You must SPECIFY THE RES.
        A is also the trustee.
        No need for delivery.
        AKA deed of trust.

        OTHERWISE, for maj of trusts:

            You not only have to specify the res.
            (You must always SPECIFY THE RES.)
            You also must transfer to B.
            DELIVERY is required here.

    Difference between Trust and Power of Appointment

        Trust: To A as trustee, to distribute to my friends {FAILS}
        PoA: To A, to distribute among my friends {VALID}

        If you want to do something stupid like this, use a PoA, not a trust.
        PoA's can have unascertainable beneficiaries

    ANIMAL TRUSTS:

        x to unidentified animals = charitable trust. valid.

            not an estate tax deduction though.

        x to my dog[s] = invalid.

            best you could hope for was an honorary trust.

        common law:  pet trusts are at best honorary trusts

            the trustee does not actually have to live up to the duty
                the settlor or his estate would have standing if the trustee doesnt live up to it
                the remedy is to impose a resulting trust.
                    the trustee holds the dough for [x]

            a trust has to comply with the RAP
                animals cannot be a validating life
                they almost always failed for this

        UTC: majority of states have adopted pet trust statutes

            it lets off on the RAP strictness

    HONORARY TRUSTS

        have usually been for care of gravestones

        specified graves:

            not charitable
            violates RAP most likely

        graves in an area:

            charitable
            survives

        UTC now allows PURPOSE TRUSTS so long as theyre not capricious

    ORAL TRUSTS

        permitted, but
        are historically very hard to prove

            typically it's one person claiming a trust for their benefit
            and the settlor is dead
            C&C evidence is usually required
